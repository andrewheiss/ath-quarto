In a couple days, I'm going to drive across the country to Utah, my home state. I haven't been out west with my whole family in four years—not since 2019 when we moved from Spanish Fork, Utah to Atlanta, Georgia. According to Google Maps, [it's a mere 1,900 miles](https://goo.gl/maps/aGXJPL85LMTW2cuS9) (3,000 kilometers) through the middle of the United States and should take 28 hours, assuming no stops. 

![Google Maps route from Atlanta, Georgia to Spanish Fork, Utah](img/google-maps-ga-to-ut.png)

For bonus fun though, my wife and I decided to make this trip even more adventurous and hit as many exciting stops as possible. So rather than drive through the middle of Kansas, we're going along the southern border on the way there, visiting New Orleans, Louisiana; San Antonio, Texas; [Carlsbad Caverns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsbad_Caverns_National_Park), New Mexico; the [Grand Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon) in Arizona; and then camping for a couple days at [Capitol Reef National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Reef_National_Park) in Southern Utah before finally arriving at my aunt's house in Spanish Fork, Utah. On the way home, we're going across the northern part of the United States, visiting my sister in Idaho before heading towards [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park) in Wyoming; [Devil's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Tower) in Wyoming; [Mount Rushmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore) in South Dakota; and [Nauvoo, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauvoo,_Illinois) ([Mormons!](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/locations/historic-nauvoo)). It's going to be an awesome—but *way* longer—mega road trip. 

To help keep six kids entertained beyond just plugging them into iPads, my wife made some road trip journals to make the experience more memorable and educational, and we're bringing a bunch of books and extra materials about each of the stops we'll be making so they can do research along the way.

I just finished revamping my [online data visualization class](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/) this week since the summer semester is starting next week, so visualizing data through maps has been on my mind. In my session on visualizing maps, [I added a section on making and visualizing your own geocoded data](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/12-example.html#making-your-own-geocoded-data) (i.e. plotting specific cities on a map), so I figured it would be neat to visualize this huge road trip somehow to make some maps to include in the kids' journals.

Getting the latitude and longitude coordinates for specific cities or addresses is super easy—you can either [right click on Google Maps and copy specific coordinates](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/12-example.html#making-your-own-geocoded-data), or you can [automate it](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/12-example.html#automatic-geoencoding-by-address) with the [{tidygeocoder} package](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/) in R. 

Getting route coordinates is a lot trickier though, since it involves all sorts of complex algorithms (accounting for road locations, speed limits, traffic, etc.). This is why Google Maps is so invaluable—it does an excellent job of figuring this out. But Google's data is proprietary. 

There's an R package named [{mapsapi}](https://github.com/michaeldorman/mapsapi) that makes it really easy to get data from the Google Maps API, and if you get an API key from Google ([following these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start#create-project)), you can extract geocoded {sf}-compatible route data from Google with the `mp_directions()` function. It's neat and quick and easy, but it's expensive. When I first started playing with the maps API in R, I racked up \$0.50 in charges just with testing a bunch of routing options. The Google Maps API gives you \$200 in free credits every month and I was well below that amount, but it still was a little nervewracking to see that it was that expensive in just an hour of tinkering. Also, setting up the API key was fairly complicated (creating a Google Cloud project, setting up billing, enabling specific services, storing the API securely on my computer, etc.), and I don't want to go through that hassle in the future.

![Google Maps API costs](img/google-maps-api-costs.png)

I'm a fan of the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and it's one of the backends (through [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/)) for {tidygeocoder} (and I used it in a [previous blog post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/04/26/middle-earth-mapping-sf-r-gis/#in-the-united-states) showing some coordinates in interactive Leaflet maps). In searching around the internet for open source alternatives to the Google Maps API, I discovered that OpenStreetMap can also do directions and routing through the [Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) project](http://project-osrm.org/). You can use OSRM's [public demo server](https://map.project-osrm.org) for small-scale routing things, or you can [install your own local instance through Docker](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend#using-docker). And super conveniently, there's also an R package called [{osrm}](https://github.com/riatelab/osrm) for accessing the OSRM API. This means that it's possible to pull geocoded routing and directions data into R in an open source (and free!) way.

So let's see how to use {osrm} and make some neat road trip maps with {sf} and {ggplot2}!

# Getting started

## Who this post is for

Here's what I assume you know:

- You're familiar with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (particularly [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)).
- You're somewhat familiar with [{sf}](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for working with geographic data. I have a [whole tutorial here](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/12-example.html) and a [simplified one here](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/04/26/middle-earth-mapping-sf-r-gis/#lightning-quick-overview-of-sf-and-shapefiles) and the [{sf} documentation has a ton of helpful vignettes and blog posts](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), and there are also two free books about it: [*Spatial Data Science*](https://r-spatial.org/book/) and [*Geocomputation with R*](https://r.geocompx.org/). Also [check this fantastic post out](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/simple-feature-objects/) to learn more about the anatomy of a `geometry` column with {sf}.

## Packages and functions

Before officially getting started, let’s load all the packages we need and create some helpful functions and variables:

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)     # ggplot, dplyr, and friends
library(sf)            # Handle spatial data in R in a tidy way
library(tigris)        # Access geographic data from the US Census
library(tidygeocoder)  # Automated geocoding
library(osrm)          # Access OSRM through R
library(ggrepel)       # Nicer non-overlapping labels
library(glue)          # Easier string interpolation
library(scales)        # Nicer labeling functions
library(patchwork)     # Combine plots nicely
library(ggspatial)     # Nicer map features like scale bars

# Custom ggplot theme to make pretty plots
# Get the font at https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass
theme_roadtrip <- function() {
  theme_void(base_family = "Overpass Light") +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(family = "Overpass", face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
      strip.text = element_text(
        family = "Overpass ExtraBold", face = "plain",
        size = rel(1.1), hjust = 0.5)
    )
}

# Make labels use Overpass by default
update_geom_defaults("label_repel", 
                     list(family = "Overpass",
                          fontface = "plain"))
update_geom_defaults("label", 
                     list(family = "Overpass",
                          fontface = "plain"))

update_geom_defaults("text_repel", 
                     list(family = "Overpass",
                          fontface = "plain"))
update_geom_defaults("text", 
                     list(family = "Overpass",
                          fontface = "plain"))

# Yellowstone colors
clrs <- NatParksPalettes::natparks.pals("Yellowstone")
```

```{r helper-functions}
#' Format duration in minutes and hours
#'
#' This function takes a numeric input \code{x} representing a duration in minutes,
#' rounds it to the nearest 15 minutes, and formats the result as a string
#' indicating the number of hours and minutes in the duration.
#'
#' @param x A numeric input representing a duration in minutes.
#' @return A character vector of formatted duration strings.
#' @examples
#' fmt_duration(c(93, 1007, 3056))
fmt_duration <- function(x) {
  # Round to the nearest 15 minutes
  n_seconds <- round(seconds(x * 60) / (15 * 60)) * (15 * 60)
  n_seconds <- seconds_to_period(n_seconds)
  
  out <- map_chr(n_seconds, \(n) {
    if (seconds(n) <= 59) {
      # If this is less than an hour, don't format anything with hours
      glue("{MM} minutes", MM = minute(n))
    } else {
      # I only want to format this as a number of hours. If the duration is
      # longer than 24 hours, seconds_to_period() rolls over into days (i.e.
      # seconds_to_period(60 * 60 * 24) returns "1d 0H 0M 0S"), and it shows
      # zero hours. So we extract the day part of the period, multiply it by 24,
      # and add it to the hour component that we want to display
      extra_day_hours <- day(n) * 24
  
      glue("{HH} hour{s} {MM} minutes",
        HH = scales::label_comma()(hour(n) + extra_day_hours),
        MM = minute(n),
        s = ifelse(hour(n) == 1, "", "s")
      )
    }
  })
  
  return(out)
}

fmt_miles <- scales::label_number(accuracy = 10, suffix = " miles", big.mark = ",")

miles_to_meters <- function(x) {
  x * 1609.344
}

meters_to_miles <- function(x) {
  x / 1609.344
}

km_to_miles <- function(x) {
  meters_to_miles(x * 1000)
}
```


# State data

First we need state boundaries. We can get these from the US Census with `states()` from {tigris}:

```{r get-us-states-fake, eval=FALSE}
us_states <- states(resolution = "20m", year = 2022, cb = TRUE)

lower_48 <- us_states %>% 
  filter(!(NAME %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico")))
```

```{r get-us-states-actual, include=FALSE}
states_file <- "states.rds"

if (file.exists(states_file)) {
  us_states <- readRDS(states_file)
} else {
  us_states <- states(resolution = "20m", year = 2022, cb = TRUE)
  saveRDS(us_states, states_file)
}

lower_48 <- us_states %>% 
    filter(!(NAME %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico")))
```

Here's what they look like (using the [Albers projection for the contiguous USA](https://epsg.io/102003)): 

```{r plot-states-only}
#| fig-cap: "48 contiguous states"
#| fig-alt: "48 contiguous states"
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = lower_48) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip()
```

Super quick and easy.

# Stops data

Next we need to geocode and plot all the stops we'll be making on the trip. I'll stick them all in a data frame with columns indicating the direction (with a nod to Bilbo Baggins's ["There and Back Again"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_and_Back_Again_(disambiguation)) journey with the dwarves in *The Hobbit*) and the day of the leg of the trip:

```{r create-stops-raw}
stops_raw <- tribble(
  ~direction,   ~day, ~city,
  "There",      1,    "Atlanta, Georgia", 
  "There",      2,    "New Orleans, Louisiana", 
  "There",      3,    "San Antonio, Texas", 
  "There",      4,    "Carlsbad, New Mexico", 
  "There",      5,    "Grand Canyon NP, Arizona",
  "There",      6,    "Grover, Utah",  
  "Back again", 1,    "Spanish Fork, Utah", 
  "Back again", 1,    "Shelley, Idaho",  
  "Back again", 2,    "Yellowstone NP, Wyoming",
  "Back again", 2,    "Devil's Tower, Wyoming",  
  "Back again", 3,    "Mount Rushmore, South Dakota", 
  "Back again", 4,    "Albert Lea, Minnesota", 
  "Back again", 5,    "Nauvoo, Illinois", 
  "Back again", 6,    "Atlanta, Georgia"
)  %>% 
  mutate(direction = fct_inorder(direction))
stops_raw
```

I could go to Google Maps and right click on each of these places and copy the latitude/longitude coordinates, but that's not very reproducible and involves a lot of clicking around. We can do it programmatically with `geocode()` from {tidygeocoder}, but first we need to help the API a little. With most of these places, OpenStreetMap will return the center of the city (like with Atlanta), and that's fine. With larger places like the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone, though, OpenStreetMap will give coordinates for the middle of the parks, which are literally in the middle of nowhere and will mess up our directions (since it's not really possible to drive to the middle of the whole Grand Canyon). To fix this we'll make a little dataset of some more specific addresses and join it to the list of stops. We'll geocode the more specific address column:

```{r create-addresses-raw}
stops_addresses <- tribble(
  ~city, ~address,
  "Grand Canyon NP, Arizona", "Grand Canyon Visitor Center, Arizona",
  "Yellowstone NP, Wyoming", "Old Faithful, Teton County, Wyoming",
)

stops_to_geocode <- stops_raw %>% 
  left_join(stops_addresses, by = join_by(city)) %>% 
  # Combine the address and city columns, with a preference for address
  mutate(address = coalesce(address, city))

stops_to_geocode
```

To get the coordinates, we'll feed the address column to `geocode()` and then convert the resulting numeric `long` and `lat` into an official sf geometry column (with the [WGS 84 (−180 to 180) scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System)):

```{r geocode-stops-fake, eval=FALSE}
stops_geocoded <- stops_to_geocode %>% 
  geocode(address, method = "osm") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = st_crs("EPSG:4326"))
```

```{r geocode-stops-actual, include=FALSE}
stops_file <- "stops_geocoded.rds"

if (file.exists(stops_file)) {
  stops_geocoded <- readRDS(stops_file)
} else {
  stops_geocoded <- stops_to_geocode %>% 
    geocode(address, method = "osm") %>%
    st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = st_crs("EPSG:4326"))
  
  saveRDS(stops_geocoded, stops_file)
}
```

```{r show-stops-geocoded}
stops_geocoded
```

Atlanta is in there twice, so we'll need to drop the last row so that we don't plot the points and labels for it twice:

```{r create-unique-stops}
all_stops_unique <- stops_geocoded %>% 
  slice(1:(n() - 1))
```

And let's plot it all:

```{r plot-stops-only}
#| fig-cap: All the main stops for our road trip
#| fig-alt: All the main stops for our road trip
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_unique) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = all_stops_unique,
    aes(label = city, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 1234,
    size = 3, segment.color = clrs[3], min.segment.length = 0
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip()
```

# Routing

Next we need to figure out the routes between each of these points. The `osrmRoute()` function in {osrm} takes two main arguments: (1) coordinates for the source location (`src`) and (2) coordinates for the destination location (`dst`). To make it easy to work with routing data in a dataframe, we need to manipulate the data a bit so that we get a row per route, with columns for the origin and destination cities.

We'll create a copy of the geometry column in `stops_geocoded` and shift it forward one row with `lead()` and drop the last row because it doesn't have a destination:

```{r create-routes-raw}
routes_raw <- stops_geocoded %>% 
  select(-address) %>% 
  rename(
    origin_geometry = geometry,
    origin_city = city
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    destination_geometry = lead(origin_geometry),
    destination_city = lead(origin_city)
  ) %>% 
  filter(row_number() != n())
routes_raw
```

With the data like this, we can now feed each row individually to `osrmRoute` and get geocoded paths between each origin and destination:

```{r geocode-routes-fake, eval=FALSE}
routes_geocoded_raw <- routes_raw %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(route = osrmRoute(
    src = origin_geometry, 
    dst = destination_geometry)
  )
```

```{r geocode-routes-actual, include=FALSE}
routes_file <- "routes_geocoded.rds"

if (file.exists(routes_file)) {
  routes_geocoded_raw <- readRDS(routes_file)
} else {
  routes_geocoded_raw <- routes_raw %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(route = osrmRoute(
    src = origin_geometry, 
    dst = destination_geometry)
  )
  
  saveRDS(routes_geocoded_raw, routes_file)
}
```

```{r show-routes-geocoded-raw}
routes_geocoded_raw
```

The route details are included in a [nested data frame list column](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html) named `route`, so we'll need to unnest it. The resulting data frame now has three different geometry columns (!) for the origin point, destination point, and the route, so we'll set the route column as the data frame's primary geometry column (which makes it so we can just use `geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded)` instead of `geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, aes(geometry = whatever))`). The route data also includes some helpful details about the distance (in kilometers) and duration (in minutes), so we'll create nicely formatted text-based versions of these too:

```{r unnest-clean-routes-geocoded}
routes_geocoded <- routes_geocoded_raw %>% 
  unnest(route, names_sep = "_") %>% 
  st_set_geometry("route_geometry") %>% 
  mutate(
    distance_miles = km_to_miles(route_distance),
    distance_text = fmt_miles(distance_miles),
    duration_text = fmt_duration(route_duration)
  )
routes_geocoded
```

Let's see how this looks! Because we set the default geometry of `routes_geocoded` to the route, `geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded)` will automatically plot the `LINESTRING` geometries for the routes as paths:

```{r plot-routes-stops}
#| fig-cap: Automatically geocoded routes between all our road trip stops
#| fig-alt: Automatically geocoded routes between all our road trip stops
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48) +
  geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_unique) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = all_stops_unique,
    aes(label = city, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 1234,
    size = 3, segment.color = clrs[3], min.segment.length = 0
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip()
```

AHH that's so cool! It works!

We're not done yet though—let's make this even fancier!


# States crossed through

We're going to be driving through a lot of states. Let's highlight each of the states we'll cross through to see how many there are. To do this we can use `st_intersection()` to find which of the `lower_48` states contain a part of the different routes. We'll then make a copy of `lower_48` with a new column indicating if we'll visit the state:

```{r create-states-crossed-through, warning=FALSE}
states_crossed_through <- st_intersection(
  st_transform(lower_48, st_crs(routes_geocoded)),
  routes_geocoded
)

# There are 32 rows here, but 18 unique states (i.e. one day will end in a state
# and start the next day in the same state, so it gets counted twice)
states_crossed_through %>% 
  select(STATEFP, NAME, direction, day)
unique(states_crossed_through$NAME)

# Create a column that flags if the state is cross through
lower_48_highlighted <- lower_48 %>% 
  mutate(visited = NAME %in% unique(states_crossed_through$NAME))
```

Now we can fill using the `visited` column and make the visited states subtly darker:

```{r plot-routes-stops-highlighted}
#| fig-cap: Map of road trip route with crossed-through states highlighted
#| fig-alt: Map of road trip route with crossed-through states highlighted
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_unique) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = all_stops_unique,
    aes(label = city, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 1234,
    size = 3, segment.color = clrs[3], min.segment.length = 0
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip()
```


# Summary statistics

Now that we have a list of the states we'll cross through, let's play with some quick summary statistics.

```{r create-summary-stats}
n_states <- length(unique(states_crossed_through$NAME))
n_states

total_distance <- sum(routes_geocoded$route_distance) %>% km_to_miles() %>% fmt_miles()
total_distance

total_time <- sum(routes_geocoded$route_duration) %>% fmt_duration()
total_time
```

**We're going to drive through `r n_states` states, with a total distance of `r total_distance` over the span of `r total_time` (!!)**

We can use these distance or duration columns to add some extra detail to the map:

```{r plot-routes-stops-distances}
#| fig-cap: "Map of road trip showing the distances between each stop"
#| fig-alt: "Map of road trip showing the distances between each stop"
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_unique) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = routes_geocoded,
    aes(label = distance_text, geometry = route_geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 12345,
    size = 3, segment.color = clrs[3], min.segment.length = 0,
    fill = colorspace::lighten(clrs[5], 0.8)
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  labs(title = glue("{n_states} states; {total_distance}; and {total_time} in the car. Bring it on.")) +
  theme_roadtrip()

We have some nice tidy data here with columns for direction and day, which makes it easy to subset the data. We can make separate maps for the drive there and the drive back, or even separate maps for each day of the trip. Let's add `facet_wrap()` to the plot:

```{r plot-facet-subset-issues, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
#| fig-cap: "Road trip map faceted by direction"
#| fig-alt: "Road trip map faceted by direction"
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_unique) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip() +
  facet_wrap(vars(direction), ncol = 1)
```

There are two problems with this though:

1. The highlighted states are the same in both facets
2. The final destination point is missing in each facet (Spanish Fork, Utah in the "There" facet; Atlanta, Georgia in the "Back Again" facet)

Both of these issues are fixable though.

## Fixing state highlighting

First we need to change how we identify the states we'll cross through. Before, we kept the unique state names, but this stripped away the details about the direction of the trip, so we'll find all the distinct combinations of direction and state and then join that little dataset to `lower_48` to make the `visited` column:

```{r create-states-crossed-through-better, warning=FALSE}
states_crossed_through_better <- st_intersection(
  st_transform(lower_48, st_crs(routes_geocoded)),
  routes_geocoded
) %>% 
  distinct(direction, NAME)
states_crossed_through_better

lower_48_highlighted_better <- lower_48 %>% 
  left_join(states_crossed_through_better, by = join_by(NAME)) %>% 
  mutate(visited = !is.na(direction))
as_tibble(lower_48_highlighted_better)
```

Let's see how it works by adding a new `geom_sf()` layer for the highlighted states. We need to double up here with both `lower_48` and `lower_48_highlighted_better` because if we only plot the highlighted states, each facet will only contain those states and not the underlying US map, which we don't want.

```{r plot-facet-subset-issues-fixed1, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
#| fig-cap: Each facet now only shows the states corresponding to each direction
#| fig-alt: Each facet now only shows the states corresponding to each direction
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48) +
  geom_sf(data = na.omit(lower_48_highlighted_better), aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_unique) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip() +
  facet_wrap(vars(direction), ncol = 1)
```

There, we fixed issue #1. `r emoji::emoji("check_mark_button")`

Issue #2—the missing endpoint in each facet—is a little trickier to deal with, but still doable. Before messing with the real data, let's look at a simpler toy example first. Here's a little dataset with three different "routes" between cities. The coordinates here aren't actually coordinates—they're just some arbitrary numbers. But that's okay—this basically mirrors what we have in `routes_geocoded`

## Fixing missing destination cities

```{r create-example-data-pivot}
example <- tribble(
  ~day, ~origin_city, ~destination_city, ~origin_coords, ~destination_coords,
  1,    "Atlanta",    "Boston",          1234,           5678,
  2,    "Boston",     "Chicago",         5678,           91011,
  3,    "Chicago",    "Denver",          91011,          131415
) 
example
```

The reason we're not getting the final point in each facet or subset is because there are only three rows here, but four cities. If we plotted the `origin_coords` column, Atlanta would be missing; if we plotted the `destination_coords` column, Denver would be missing. We need to manipulate this data so that it has 4 rows (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver), with the correct coordinates for each city. 

There's an easy way to do this with `pivot_longer()` from {tidyr}. We can pivot with multiple columns that follow a pattern in their names. Here, all four of the columns we care about are are prefixed `destination` or `origin`, followed by a `_`. If we specify these name settings in `pivot_longer()`, it'll automatically create a column named `type` for destination and origin and it'll put the rest of the data in corresponding columns:

```{r show-example-double-pivot}
example %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(origin_city, destination_city, origin_coords, destination_coords),
    names_to = c("type", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_"
  )
```

Now we have one row per city, which is close to what we need. Boston and Chicago are duplicated (since they're both destination and origin cities), so we need to filter out duplicate cities. There are lots of ways to do this—my preferred way is to group by city and keep the first row in each group using `slice()`:

```{r show-example-double-pivot-filter}
example %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(origin_city, destination_city, origin_coords, destination_coords),
    names_to = c("type", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  slice(1)
```

Woohoo! A dataset with four rows and the correct coordinates for each city. If we could plot this, we'd get both endpoints (Atlanta and Denver).

This same double pivot approach (magically!!) works with the special geometry columns in our actual routes data:

```{r create-stops-endpoints}
all_stops_endpoints <- routes_geocoded %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(origin_city, destination_city, origin_geometry, destination_geometry),
    names_to = c("type", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(direction, city) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  arrange(direction, day, desc(type)) %>% 
  # Use "geometry" as the default geometry column instead of the routes
  st_set_geometry("geometry")

all_stops_endpoints
```

And plotted:

```{r plot-facet-subset-issues-fixed2, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
#| fig-cap: Each facet now shows the destination city
#| fig-alt: Each facet now shows the destination city
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48) +
  geom_sf(data = na.omit(lower_48_highlighted_better), aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = routes_geocoded, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = all_stops_endpoints) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = all_stops_endpoints,
    aes(label = city, geometry = geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 1234,
    size = 3, segment.color = clrs[3], min.segment.length = 0
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip() +
  facet_wrap(vars(direction), ncol = 1)
```

Issue #2 fixed. `r emoji::emoji("check_mark_button")`


# Zooming in

We can also make separate maps that are zoomed in on each day of the trip in addition these bigger overarching ones. This will allow us to add more details like driving time and distances without getting too crowded on the map.

We'll create a mini map of the first day by itself, and then scale up the process to make all the mini maps programmatically. 

## One day of the trip

First we'll extract the route, cities, and states for the first day of the trip out there:

```{r extract-day1, warning=FALSE}
route_day1 <- routes_geocoded %>% 
  filter(direction == "There", day == 1)

stops_day1 <- all_stops_endpoints %>% 
  filter(direction == "There", day == 1)

states_crossed_day1 <- st_intersection(
  st_transform(lower_48, st_crs(route_day1)),
  route_day1
) %>% 
  distinct(NAME)

lower_48_highlighted_day1 <- lower_48 %>% 
  mutate(visited = NAME %in% states_crossed_day1$NAME)
```

Let's plot these to make sure it worked:

```{r plot-day1-preliminary}
#| fig-cap: Drive for the first day on the full US map
#| fig-alt: Drive for the first day on the full US map
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted_day1, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = route_day1, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = stops_day1) +
  geom_sf_label(
    data = stops_day1, 
    aes(label = city),
    nudge_y = miles_to_meters(80)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")) +  # Albers
  theme_roadtrip()
```

Yep, it worked. But we don't need to show the whole map—we want to zoom in on just the area around the route for the day. To do this, we can use `st_bbox()` to extract a rectangle of coordinates around the route, creating a bounding box for the map that we can then use with `coord_sf()` to zoom in.

`st_bbox()` returns a named vector of numbers with the x- and y-axis limits:

```{r extract-bbox-basic}
bbox <- st_bbox(route_day1)
bbox
```

Since the elements are all named, we can use them to specify the different values in `coord_sf()`. First we'll temporarily stop using the [Albers projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection), since the numbers we've extracted with `st_bbox()` are on the [WGS 84 (−180 to 180) scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) and Albers uses meters, which will make the map not work. (But we'll fix that in a minute!)

```{r plot-day1-bbox-basic, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Trip for the first day, but zoomed in a little too far
#| fig-alt: Trip for the first day, but zoomed in a little too far
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted_day1, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = route_day1, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = stops_day1) +
  geom_sf_label(
    data = stops_day1, 
    aes(label = city),
    # We're not using Albers, so this isn't measured in meters; it's decimal degrees
    nudge_y = 0.15
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(bbox["xmin"], bbox["xmax"]), 
    ylim = c(bbox["ymin"], bbox["ymax"])
  ) +
  theme_roadtrip()
```

We're zoomed in (yay) but the edges of the bounding box window are too close to the points and the route, and the labels are cropped funny. Also, to shift the labels up we had to think in [decimal degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees) instead of meters, which I can't do naturally. And also, we can't change projections—because we're specifying the bounding box coordinates in decimal degrees, we're stuck with WGS 84 instead of Albers or any other projection. These are all fixable issues, fortunately.

To fix all this, we'll expand the bounding box window by 150 miles on all sides using `st_buffer()` and then convert the coordinates to Albers before extracting the coordinates of the window for plotting:

```{r extract-bbox-buffer-albers}
bbox_nice <- route_day1 %>% 
  st_bbox() %>%  # Extract the bounding box of the coordinates
  st_as_sfc() %>%  # Convert the bounding box matrix back to an sf object
  st_buffer(miles_to_meters(150)) %>%  # Add 150 miles to all sides
  st_transform("ESRI:102003") %>%  # Switch to Albers
  st_bbox()  # Extract the bounding box of the expanded box
bbox_nice
```

These are no longer in decimal degrees, so we can use them with the Albers projection. We've also added a 150-mile buffer around the window, so we should have room for all the labels now. Let's check it:

```{r plot-day1-bbox-buffer-albers, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Trip for the first day, correctly zoomed and using the Albers projection
#| fig-alt: Trip for the first day, correctly zoomed and using the Albers projection
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted_day1, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = route_day1, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = stops_day1) +
  geom_sf_label(
    data = stops_day1, 
    aes(label = city),
    # We're in Albers again, so we can work with meters (or miles)
    nudge_y = miles_to_meters(30)
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass",
    width_hint = 0.4
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(bbox_nice["xmin"], bbox_nice["xmax"]), 
    ylim = c(bbox_nice["ymin"], bbox_nice["ymax"]),
    crs = st_crs("ESRI:102003")
  ) +
  theme_roadtrip()
```

Heck yeah.

However, the shapes look a little curved and distorted because we're zoomed in so much. Albers is great for big countries, but on a small scale like this, WGS 84 is probably fine. That's what Google Maps does—it only starts getting weird and curvy along horizontal latitude lines when you zoom out really far. Let's do the first day map one last time without the Albers conversion:

```{r plot-day1-bbox-buffer-wgs84, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Trip for the first day, correctly zoomed and using the WGS 84 projection
#| fig-alt: Trip for the first day, correctly zoomed and using the WGS 84 projection
bbox_nice <- route_day1 %>% 
  st_bbox() %>%  # Extract the bounding box of the coordinates
  st_as_sfc() %>%  # Convert the bounding box matrix back to an sf object
  st_buffer(miles_to_meters(150)) %>%  # Add 150 miles to all sides
  st_bbox()  # Extract the bounding box of the expanded box

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lower_48_highlighted_day1, aes(fill = visited)) +
  geom_sf(data = route_day1, color = clrs[1]) +
  geom_sf(data = stops_day1) +
  geom_sf_label(
    data = stops_day1, 
    aes(label = city),
    # We're in WGS 84, so these are decimal degrees
    nudge_y = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = route_day1,
    aes(label = distance_text, geometry = route_geometry),
    stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 12345,
    family = "Overpass ExtraBold", fontface = "plain",
    size = 3.5, fill = colorspace::lighten(clrs[5], 0.8), color = clrs[1], 
    segment.color = "grey50", min.segment.length = 0
  ) +
  annotation_scale(
    location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
    unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass",
    width_hint = 0.3
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(bbox_nice["xmin"], bbox_nice["xmax"]), 
    ylim = c(bbox_nice["ymin"], bbox_nice["ymax"]),
    crs = st_crs("EPSG:4326")
  ) +
  theme_roadtrip()
```

Neat. The northern borders of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are all flat here, which is great.

## All the days of the trip

We successfully plotted one day of the trip. But we'll be driving for 11 days (!) and need 11 plots. I don't want to copy/paste this all code 11 times, so we'll stick each major step into a function:

```{r build-functions}
# Take a set of routes and do some pivoting to create a dataset that includes
# the start and end points
expand_endpoints <- function(routes) {
  routes %>% 
    pivot_longer(
    cols = c(origin_city, destination_city, origin_geometry, destination_geometry),
    names_to = c("type", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  arrange(desc(type)) %>% 
  st_set_geometry("geometry")
}

# Take a set of routes and return a dataset with a flag marking which states they cross
find_states <- function(routes) {
  # st_intersection() complains about innocuous things so suppress the warnings
  suppressWarnings({
    states_crossed <- st_intersection(
      st_transform(lower_48, st_crs(routes)),
      routes
    ) %>% 
      distinct(NAME)
  })
  
  lower_48 %>% 
    mutate(visited = NAME %in% states_crossed$NAME)
}

# Use routes, stopes, and states to build a plot
build_day_map <- function(routes, stops, states, direction, day) {
  bbox_nice <- routes %>%
    st_bbox() %>%  # Extract the bounding box of the coordinates
    st_as_sfc() %>%  # Convert the bounding box matrix back to an sf object
    st_buffer(miles_to_meters(150)) %>%  # Add 150 miles to all sides
    st_bbox()  # Extract the bounding box of the expanded box

  ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = states, aes(fill = visited)) +
    geom_sf(data = routes, color = clrs[1]) +
    geom_sf(data = stops) +
    geom_sf_label(
      data = stops,
      aes(label = city),
      # We're in WGS 84, so these are decimal degrees
      nudge_y = 0.4
    ) +
    geom_label_repel(
      data = routes,
      aes(label = distance_text, geometry = route_geometry),
      stat = "sf_coordinates", seed = 12345,
      family = "Overpass ExtraBold", fontface = "plain",
      size = 3.5, fill = colorspace::lighten(clrs[5], 0.8), color = clrs[1], 
      segment.color = "grey50", min.segment.length = 0
    ) +
    annotation_scale(
      location = "bl", bar_cols = c("grey30", "white"),
      unit_category = "imperial", text_family = "Overpass",
      width_hint = 0.4
    ) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey90", "grey80"), guide = "none") +
    coord_sf(
      xlim = c(bbox_nice["xmin"], bbox_nice["xmax"]),
      ylim = c(bbox_nice["ymin"], bbox_nice["ymax"]),
      crs = st_crs("EPSG:4326")
    ) +
    labs(title = glue("{direction}, day {day}")) +
    theme_roadtrip()
}
```

With everything functionalized, we can do some super wild {purrr} magic. If we take `routes_geocoded` and group it by direction and day (so there's a group per driving day), we'll get a list column that contains the geocded coordinates for each day:

```{r show-nested-data}
daily_plots <- routes_geocoded %>% 
  group_by(direction, day) %>% 
  nest(.key = "routes")

daily_plots

# Check the first day
daily_plots$routes[[1]]

# Check the first day of the return trip
daily_plots$routes[[7]]
```

We can then use `purrr::map()` and `purrr::pmap()` to feed that nested list-column data frame through the different functions to expand endpoints, find crossed-through states, and build the daily plot.

```{r build-daily-plots}
daily_plots <- routes_geocoded %>% 
  group_by(direction, day) %>% 
  nest(.key = "routes") %>% 
  mutate(
    stops = map(routes, expand_endpoints),
    states = map(routes, find_states),
    plot = pmap(list(routes, stops, states, direction, day), build_day_map)
  )
```

Before looking at the plots, check out all these nested datasets! Each day has a dataset for the routes, stops, states, and final plot, and everything is contained here in a data frame. MAGICAL.

```{r show-daily-plots-nested-df}
daily_plots
```

We can extract the plot for any single day with indexing:

```{r plot-day10-indexed, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Trip for the day 4 of the return trip
#| fig-alt: Trip for the day 4 of the return trip
daily_plots$plot[[10]]
```

Or we can filter, pull, and pluck like good denizens of the tidyverse:

```{r plot-day5-verbose, warning=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: Trip for the day 5 of the return trip
#| fig-alt: Trip for the day 5 of the return trip
daily_plots %>% 
  filter(direction == "Back again", day == 5) %>% 
  pull(plot) %>% pluck(1)
```

Here's all of them simultaneously inside a [Quarto tabset](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#tabsets), just for fun:

:::: {.panel-tabset}

## The trip there

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Day 1

```{r panel-there-day1, warning=FALSE}
daily_plots$plot[[1]]
```

### Day 2

```{r panel-there-day2, warning=FALSE}
daily_plots$plot[[2]]
```

### Day 3

```{r panel-there-day3, warning=FALSE}

```

```

### Day 6

```{r panel-there-day6, warning=FALSE}

```
:::

## The trip back again

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Day 1

```{r panel-back-day1, warning=FALSE}

```

### Day 3

```{r panel-back-day3, warning=FALSE}
daily_plots$plot[[9]]
```

### Day 4

```{r panel-back-day4, warning=FALSE}
daily_plots$plot[[10]]
```

### Day 5

```{r panel-back-day5, warning=FALSE}
daily_plots$plot[[11]]
```
:::

::::

Or, instead of extracting each plot individually like this, we can use `wrap_plots()` from {patchwork} to combine a whole list of plots automatically, though we have a lot less control over the plots this way—some of the maps use a landscape orientation and some use a portrait orientation, so they're a big mess when combined like this:

```{r patchwork-everything-ugly, warning=FALSE, fig.width=16, fig.height=8}
#| column: screen-inset
#| fig-alt: Ugly massive plot of all the days of the trip
daily_plots %>%
  pull(plot) %>% 
  wrap_plots()
```

Time to add some maps to road trip journals and finish packing!

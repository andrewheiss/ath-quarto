People often ask me what programs I use for my writing and design. In truth, my workflow tends to look like [this](https://xkcd.com/1579/) or [this](https://xkcd.com/1172/), but here's a more detailed list of all the interconnected programs I use.

I try to keep this updated fairly regularly. As of April 27, 2025 this is what I'm using: 


## Writing

- I permanently ditched Word as a writing environment in 2008 after starting grad school. I do all my writing in [pandoc-flavored](http://pandoc.org/) [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (including e-mails and paper-and-pencil writing)—it's incredibly intuitive, imminently readable, flexible, future proof, and lets me ignore formatting and focus on content.
- The key to my writing workflow is the magical [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which converts Markdown files into basically anything else. I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to convert Markdown to HTML, PDF (through LaTeX), Word, and any other output format.
- I do my academic writing in several different programs: for stats-heavy stuff, I use [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), and for prose-heavy stuff, I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) or [Typora](https://typora.io/). I used to use [Ulysses](http://ulyssesapp.com/) (and still think it's a fantastic app!), but I found that I wasn't using it as much in the past few years as I've switched to Quarto for my writing.
- I store all my bibliographic references, books, and articles in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) ([see here for why](/blog/2023/01/08/bibdesk-to-zotero-pandoc/)).
- I read and annotate all my PDFs with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), both on desktop and on iOS, since it can export annotations as clean plain text.
- I store all my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Before switching to Obsidian I used [Bear](https://bear.app/), which was great but didn't support fancier things like math or syntax highlighting. Before that, I used [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/), but I abandoned it in September 2018 after 9 years of heavy use, given their ongoing privacy controversies and mass layoffs.


## Development

### Science and research

- I post almost everything I write or develop on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewheiss).
- I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and either [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) or [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) for most of my statistical computing, and I'm a dedicated devotee of the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/). In the interest of full reproducibility and transparency, I make [Quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) for each of my projects. [See a list of these websites](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/).
- I also use [Python](https://www.python.org/) occasionally. Every few months I play with pandas and numpy and Jupyter, but I'm far more comfortable with R for scientific computing.
- I adapted the idea for research haikus [from Kirby Nielsen](https://kirbyknielsen.com/research/).
- I use [The Rogue Scholar](https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/andrewheiss) to create stable DOIs for each of my blog posts.

### Web

- I run my main web server on a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet, and [I spin up temporary droplets all the time](https://github.com/andrewheiss/cloud-config-files) to offload scraping scripts, complicated R models, and to create on-the-fly VPNs.
- I normally access my remote files through SSH in a terminal, but for more complicated things, I've found that [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/) is indispensable.
- My website uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
- I use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for SSL.

### Miscellaneous

- I use a [system-wide hotkey](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html#hotkey-window) (``ctrl + ` ``) to open [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) from anywhere.
- I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Unix-y programs.
- I'm partial to both [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and [Consolas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas) for my monospaced fonts.


## Desktop apps

### Graphic design

- Though I regularly use LaTeX (through pandoc), I adore [InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html) and use it to make fancier academic and policy documents. I also used it for [all the typesetting I did](https://github.com/andrewheiss/maxwell-institute-typesetting/blob/master/books-i-made.md) for [BYU's Neal A. Maxwell Institute](http://mi.byu.edu/), and continue to use it for the books I typset for [By Common Consent Press](https://www.bccpress.org/).
- I use [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) all the time to enhance graphics I make in R and to make non-data-driven figures and diagrams.
- I use [Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) and [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) too, but less often nowadays.
- Despite my dislike for Word and Excel, I use PowerPoint for all my presentations. It's not my favorite, but in the apocryphal words of Churchill, "PowerPoint is the worst form of slide editor, except for all the others."

### Productivity

- My secret for avoiding the siren call of the internet is [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/). I have a blocklist that blocks Bluesky, Mastodon, Facebook, and Instagram from 8:00 AM–5:00 PM and 9:00 PM–11:59 PM.
- I was an early convert to [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) and used it for years until my tasks and projects got too unwieldy. I switched to [Taskpaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) for a while, used [2Do](http://www.2doapp.com/) for a couple years, and now I'm a convert to [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus).
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)’s natural language input is a glorious thing.
- I use [Timery](https://timeryapp.com/) as an interface to [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to [track my time](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-time-tracking-app/) during the day
- I keep a log of what I work on (and occasionally do more traditional diary-like entries) with [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) on both iOS and macOS.
- I use [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) to replace and expand a ton of snippets—[see them all here](https://github.com/andrewheiss/espanso), and I use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) to run dozens of little scripts that help control my computer with the keyboard.
- I use [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) to show weather, iTunes track information, and my todo lists on my desktop.
- I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) for syncing stuff across my different devices and use [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) to back up all the computers in our house to the cloud.
- With all these little helper apps, I use [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) to keep my menubar clean.


## Hardware

- I use a 2021 14″ M1 Max MacBook Pro, a 13″ iPad Pro, and an iPhone 13.
- I use a [Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Spotlight-Presentation-Remote-Highlighting/dp/B07S5HMQBH) when presenting, and when I teach in hybrid settings, I use an [Insta360 Link motion sensing camera](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Spotlight-Presentation-Remote-Highlighting/dp/B07S5HMQBH) and [a wireless lavalier microphone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095K9T8QH).

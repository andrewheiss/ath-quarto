I explore two different estimands that social scientists are interested in—causal average marginal component effects (AMCEs) and descriptive marginal means—and show how to find them with R, with both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.\n\nHowever, that post is a little wrong. It's not *wrong* wrong, but it is a bit oversimplified.\n\nWhen political scientists, psychologists, economists, and other social scientists analyze conjoint data, they overwhelmingly do it with [ordinary least squares (OLS) regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares), or just standard linear regression (`lm(y ~ x)` in R; `reg y x` in Stata). Even if the outcome is binary, they'll use OLS and call it a linear probability model. The main R package for working with conjoint data in a frequentist way ([{cregg}](https://thomasleeper.com/cregg/)) uses OLS and linear probability models. Social scientists (and economists in particular) adore OLS.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<figure>\n<video controls loop width=\"90%\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n  <source src=\"img/parks-rec-ols.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n<figcaption>Video by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theotheredmund/status/1349453230762196992\">Edmund Helmer</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n```\n\n\n\nIn my earlier guide, [I showed how to analyze the data with logistic regression](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/07/25/conjoint-bayesian-frequentist-guide/#the-overall-model), but even that is still overly simplified. In reality, conjoint choice-based experiments are more complex than what regular old OLS regression—or even logistic regression—can handle (though I'm sure some econometrician somewhere has a proof showing that OLS works just fine for multinomial conjoint data :shrug:).\n\nA recent paper published in *Political Science Research and Methods* [@JensenMarbleScheve:2021] does an excellent job explaining the problem with using plain old OLS to estimate AMCEs and marginal means with conjoint data ([access the preprint here](https://williammarble.co/docs/CityLimits-April2020.pdf)). Their main argument boils down to this: OLS throws away too much useful information about (1) the relationships and covariance between the different combinations of feature levels offered to respondents, and (2) individual-specific differences in how respondents react to different feature levels.\n\nJensen et al. explain three different approaches to analyzing data that has a natural hierarchical structure like conjoint data (where lots of choices related to different \"products\" are nested within individuals). This also is the same argument from [chapter 15 of *Bayes Rules!*](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15).\n\n1. **Pooled data** ([\"no room for individuality\"](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15#ch15-complete)): The easiest way to deal with individual-specific effects is to not to. Lump each choice by each respondent into one big dataset, run OLS on it, and be done. Believe it or not, linear regression right away.\n\n   However, this erases all individual-level heterogeneity and details about how different feature levels interact with individual characteristics.\n\n2. **No pooling** ([\"every person for themselves\"](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15#no-pooling)): An alternative way to deal with individual-specific effects is to run a separate model for each individual. If 800 people participated in the experiment, run 800 different models. That way you can perfectly model the relationship between each individual's characteristics (political party, age, income, education, etc.) with their choices and preferences. \n\n   This sounds neat, but has substantial issues. It'll only show an identified causal effect if each respondent saw every combination of conjoint features at least once. In the candidate experiment [from my previous post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/07/25/conjoint-bayesian-frequentist-guide/), there were 8 features with different counts of attributes: 2 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 2 × 6 × 6 × 6 = 186,624 possibilities. Every respondent would need to see each of the nearly 200,000 options. lol.\n\n3. **Partial pooling** ([\"a welcome middle ground\"](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-15#partial-pooling-with-hierarchical-models)): Jensen et al.'s solution is to use hierarchical models that allow individual-level characteristics to inform choice-level decisions. As *Bayes Rules!* says:\n\n   > [T]hough each group is *unique*, having been sampled from the same population, all groups are connected and thus might contain valuable information about one another.\n   \n   In this kind of model, we want individual-level characteristics like age, income, education, etc. to inform the decision to choose specific outcomes and interact with different feature levels in different ways. Not every respondent needs to have seen all 200,000 options—information about respondents with similar characteristics facing similar sets of choices gets shared because of the hierarchical-ness of the model.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Best overview of multilevel models\n\nFor the best overviews I've found of how multilevel models work, check out these two resources:\n\n- Chapters 15–17 in [*Bayes Rules!*](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) ([especially chapter 17](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/chapter-17))\n- Michael Clark's [*Mixed Models with R* guide](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/)\n\n[I also have a guide here](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2021/12/01/multilevel-models-panel-data-guide/), but it's nowhere near as good as those ↑\n:::\n\nBy using a multilevel hierarchical model, @JensenMarbleScheve:2021 show that we can still find AMCEs and causal effects, just like in my previous guide, but we can take advantage of the far richer heterogeneity that we get from these complex statements. We can make cool statements like this (in an experiment that varied policies related to unions):\n\n> On average, Democrats are $x$ percentage points more likely than demographically similar Republicans to support a plan that includes expanding union power, relative to the status quo.\n\nUsing hierarchical models for conjoint experiments in political science is new and exciting and revolutionary and neat. That's the whole point of Jensen et al.'s paper—it's a call to stop using OLS for everything.\n\nI've been working on a conjoint experiment with my coauthors [Marc Dotson](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=50683) and [Suparna Chaudhry](https://www.suparnachaudhry.com/). Suparna and I are political scientists and this multilevel stuff in general is still relatively new and wildly underused in the discipline. Marc, though, is a marketing scholar. The marketing world has been using hierarchical models for conjoint experiments for a long time and it's standard practice in that discipline. There's a whole textbook about the hierarchical model approach in marketing [@ChapmanFeit:2019], and these fancy conjoint multilevel models are used widely throughout the marketing industry.\n\nlol at political science, just now discovering this.\n\n---\n\nSo, I need to expand [my previous conjoint guide](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/07/25/conjoint-bayesian-frequentist-guide/). That's what this post is for.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Who this post is for\n\nHere's what I assume you know:\n\n- You're familiar with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (particularly [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)).\n- You're familiar with linear regression and packages like [{broom}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) for converting regression results into tidy data frames and [{marginaleffects}](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/) for calculating [marginal effects](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/).\n- You're familiar with [{brms}](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) for running Bayesian regression models and [{tidybayes}](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/) and [{ggdist}](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) for manipulating and plotting posterior draws. You *don't* need to know how to write stuff in raw Stan.\n\n:::\n\nI'll do three things in this guide:\n\n1. **Chocolate**: Analyze a simple choice-based conjoint experiment where respondents only saw one set of options. This is so I can (1) explore the {mlogit} package, and (2) figure out how to work with multinomial models and predictions both frequentistly and Bayesianly.\n2. **Minivans**: Analyze a more complex choice-based conjoint experiment where respondents saw three randomly selected options fifteen times. I do this with both {mlogit} and {brms} to figure out how to work with true multinomial outcomes both frequentistly and Bayesianly.\n3. **Minivans again**: Analyze the same complex choice-based experiment but incorporate respondent-level characteristics into the estimates using a hierarchical or multilevel model. I only do this with {brms} because in reality I have no interest in working with {mlogit} (I only use it here as a sort of baseline for my {brms} explorations).\n\nThroughout this example, I'll use data from two different simulated conjoint choice experiments. You can download these files and follow along:\n\n- [{{< fa table >}} `choco_candy.csv`](data/choco_candy.csv): This is simulated data for a hypothetical experiment about consumer preferences for candy features. It comes from p. 292 in @Kuhfeld:2010, a [SAS technical note](http://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/mr2010f.pdf) about how to run multinomial models in SAS. Instead of copying/pasting from the PDF, [I found a version of it here](https://github.com/sangwoo-statistics/dataset), cleaned up by Sangwoo Kim (who also has [a YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra8Y2FjRqOE) using the same candy data)\n- [{{< fa table >}} `rintro-chapter13conjoint.csv`](data/rintro-chapter13conjoint.csv): This is simultated data for a hypothetical experiment about consumer preferences for minivan features. It comes from chapter 13 in @ChapmanFeit:2019 and is available from the [book's resources page](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/) (or [directly from their data folder](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/data/))\n\n::: {.callout-note #mclogit-note}\n### {mlogit}, {mclogit}, and {marginaleffects}\n\nIn September 2024, {marginaleffects} [removed support](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/commit/9778eef3ad98369c6e8d11ba7e894111ae6b4e94) for {mlogit} because the internal model object structure made it extremely difficult to calculate consistent results.\n\nWe can calculate predictions with {mlogit}'s version of `predict()`, but it doesn't include standard errors, so we can't find confidence intervals or other measures of uncertainty without doing fancier things like bootstrapping or using Bayesian methods. The Bayesian approach is the whole point of this tutorial, really, so take the difficulty of {mlogit}-related postestimation work as a call to convert to the wonderful world of {brms} and Bayes. :)\n\nIf you're really into frequentism and want to use {marginaleffects}, you can use [the {mclogit} package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mclogit), which comes with `mclogit()` for fitting conditional logit models just like {mlogit}, but with {marginaleffects} support.\n\nThe results that you get from `predict()` and `marginaleffects::predictions()` are different from `mlogit()` and seem to be closer to what happens with {brms}, but working with them is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nI've included examples of how to fit `mclogit()` models for both the [chocolate example](#mclogit-model) and the [minivan example](#mclogit-model-1) below.\n:::\n\nAdditionally, in [Part 3](#part-3-minivans-repeated-questions-full-hierarchical-multinomial-logit), I fit a huge Stan model with {brms} that takes ≈30 minutes to run on my fast laptop. If you want to follow along and not melt your CPU for half an hour, you can download an .rds file of that fitted model that I stuck in [an OSF project](https://osf.io/3y7es/). The code for `brm()` later in this guide will load the .rds file automatically instead of rerunning the model as long as you put it in a folder named \"models\" in your working directory. This code uses the [{osfr} package](https://docs.ropensci.org/osfr/) to download [the .rds file from OSF](https://osf.io/zp6eh) automatically and places it where it needs to go:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(osfr)  # Interact with OSF via R\n\n# Make a \"models\" folder if it doesn't exist already\nif (!file.exists(\"models\")) { dir.create(\"models\") }\n\n# Download model_minivans_mega_mlm_brms.rds from OSF\nosf_retrieve_file(\"https://osf.io/zp6eh\") |>\n  osf_download(path = \"models\", conflicts = \"overwrite\", progress = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's load some libraries, create some helper functions, load the data, and get started!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)        # ggplot, dplyr, and friends\nlibrary(broom)            # Convert model objects to tidy data frames\nlibrary(parameters)       # Show model results as nice tables\nlibrary(survey)           # Panel-ish frequentist regression models\nlibrary(mlogit)           # Frequentist multinomial regression models\nlibrary(dfidx)            # Structure data for {mlogit} models\nlibrary(scales)           # Nicer labeling functions\nlibrary(marginaleffects)  # Calculate marginal effects\nlibrary(ggforce)          # For facet_col()\nlibrary(brms)             # The best formula-based interface to Stan\nlibrary(tidybayes)        # Manipulate Stan results in tidy ways\nlibrary(ggdist)           # Fancy distribution plots\nlibrary(patchwork)        # Combine ggplot plots\nlibrary(rcartocolor)      # Color palettes from CARTOColors (https://carto.com/carto-colors/)\n\n# Custom ggplot theme to make pretty plots\n# Get the font at https://github.com/intel/clear-sans\ntheme_nice <- function() {\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Clear Sans\") +\n    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          plot.title = element_text(family = \"Clear Sans\", face = \"bold\"),\n          axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0),\n          axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 1),\n          strip.text = element_text(family = \"Clear Sans\", face = \"bold\",\n                                    size = rel(0.75), hjust = 0),\n          strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey90\", color = NA))\n}\n\ntheme_set(theme_nice())\n\nclrs <- carto_pal(name = \"Prism\")\n\n# Functions for formatting things as percentage points\nlabel_pp <- label_number(accuracy = 1, scale = 100, \n                         suffix = \" pp.\", style_negative = \"minus\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchocolate <- read_csv(\"data/choco_candy.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    dark = case_match(dark, 0 ~ \"Milk\", 1 ~ \"Dark\"),\n    dark = factor(dark, levels = c(\"Milk\", \"Dark\")),\n    soft = case_match(soft, 0 ~ \"Chewy\", 1 ~ \"Soft\"),\n    soft = factor(soft, levels = c(\"Chewy\", \"Soft\")),\n    nuts = case_match(nuts, 0 ~ \"No nuts\", 1 ~ \"Nuts\"),\n    nuts = factor(nuts, levels = c(\"No nuts\", \"Nuts\"))\n  )\n\nminivans <- read_csv(\"data/rintro-chapter13conjoint.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    across(c(seat, cargo, price), factor),\n    carpool = factor(carpool, levels = c(\"no\", \"yes\")),\n    eng = factor(eng, levels = c(\"gas\", \"hyb\", \"elec\"))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\\ \n\n# Part 1: Candy; single question; basic multinomial logit\n\n## The setup\n\nIn this experiment, respondents are asked to choose which of these kinds of candies they'd want to buy.

To do this, we can use [multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression), where the outcome variable is an unordered categorical variable with more than two categories. In this case we have eight different possible outcomes: alternatives A through H.\n\n\n### Original SAS model as a baseline\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n#### lol SAS\n\nI know nothing about SAS. I have never opened SAS in my life. It is a mystery to me.\n\nI copied these results directly from p. 297 in SAS's massive [\"Discrete Choice\" technical note](http://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/mr2010f.pdf) [@Kuhfeld:2010].\n\nI only have this SAS output here as a baseline reference for what the actual correct coefficients are supposed to be.\n:::\n\nSAS apparently fits these models with proportional hazard survival-style models, which feels weird, but there's probably a mathematical or statistical reason for it. You use PROC PHREG to do it:\n\n```default\nproc phreg data=chocs outest=betas;\n   strata subj set;\n   model c*c(2) = dark soft nuts / ties=breslow;\n   run;\n```\n\nIt gives these results:\n\n```default\n                   Choice of Chocolate Candies\n\n                       The PHREG Procedure\n\n              Multinomial Logit Parameter Estimates\n              \n                      Parameter     Standard\n                 DF    Estimate        Error  Chi-Square   Pr > ChiSq\nDark Chocolate   1      1.38629      0.79057      3.0749       0.0795\nSoft Center      1     -2.19722      1.05409      4.3450       0.0371\nWith Nuts        1      0.84730      0.69007      1.5076       0.2195\n```\n\n### Survival model\n\nEw, enough SAS. Let's do this with R instead.\n\nWe can recreate the same proportional hazards model with `coxph()` from the {survival} package. Again, this feels weird and not like an intended purpose of survival models and not like multinomial logit at all—in my mind it is neither (1) multinomial nor (2) logit, but whatever. People far smarter than me invented these things, so I'll just trust them.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_chocolate_survival <- coxph(\n  Surv(subj, choice) ~ dark + soft + nuts, \n  data = chocolate, \n  ties = \"breslow\"  # This is what SAS uses\n)\n\nmodel_parameters(model_chocolate_survival, digits = 4, p_digits = 4)\n## Parameter   | Coefficient |     SE |             95% CI |       z |      p\n## --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## dark [Dark] |      1.3863 | 0.7906 | [-0.1632,  2.9358] |  1.7535 | 0.0795\n## soft [Soft] |     -2.1972 | 1.0541 | [-4.2632, -0.1312] | -2.0845 | 0.0371\n## nuts [Nuts] |      0.8473 | 0.6901 | [-0.5052,  2.1998] |  1.2279 | 0.2195\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe coefficients, standard errors, and p-values are identical to the SAS output! The only difference is the statistic: in SAS they use a chi-square statistic, while `survival:coxph()` uses a z statistic. There's probably a way to make `coxph()` use a chi-square statistic, but I don't care about that. I never use survival models and I'm only doing this to replicate the SAS output and it just doesn't matter.\n\n### Poisson model\n\nAn alternative way to fit a multinomial logit model without resorting to survival models is to actually (mis?)use another model family. We can use a Poisson model, even though `choice` isn't technically count data, because of obscure stats reasons. [See here](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat504/lesson/2/2.3/2.3.6) for an illustration of the relationship between multinomial and Poisson distributions; or [see this 2011 *Biometrika* paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asr026) about using Poisson models to reduce bias in multinomial logit models. Richard McElreath has a subsection about this in *Statistical Rethinking* as well: \"Multinomial in disguise as Poisson\" (11.3.3). Or [as he said over on the currently-walled-garden Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rmcelreath.bsky.social/post/3k4e5s6zbxc2j), \"All count distributions are just one or more Poisson distributions in a trench coat.\" \n\nTo account for the repeated subjects in the data, we'll use `svyglm()` from the {survey} package so that the standard errors are more accurate.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_chocolate_poisson <- glm(\n  choice ~ dark + soft + nuts, \n  data = chocolate, \n  family = poisson()\n)\n\nmodel_parameters(model_chocolate_poisson, digits = 4, p_digits = 4)\n## Parameter   | Log-Mean |     SE |             95% CI |       z |      p\n## -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n## (Intercept) |  -2.9188 | 0.8628 | [-4.9727, -1.4905] | -3.3829 | 0.0007\n## dark [Dark] |   1.3863 | 0.7906 | [ 0.0023,  3.2772] |  1.7535 | 0.0795\n## soft [Soft] |  -2.1972 | 1.0541 | [-5.1119, -0.5256] | -2.0845 | 0.0371\n## nuts [Nuts] |   0.8473 | 0.6901 | [-0.4328,  2.3820] |  1.2279 | 0.2195\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLovely—the results are the same.\n\n### `mlogit` model\n\nFinally, we can use the {mlogit} package to fit the model. Before using `mlogit()`, we need to transform our data a bit to specify which column represents the choice (`choice)` and how the data is indexed: subjects (`subj`) with repeated alternatives (`alt`).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchocolate_idx <- dfidx(\n  chocolate,\n  idx = list(\"subj\", \"alt\"),\n  choice = \"choice\",\n  shape = \"long\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can then use this indexed data frame with `mlogit()`, which uses the familiar R formula interface, but with some extra features separated by `|`s\n\n```default\noutcome ~ features | individual-level variables | alternative-level variables\n```\n\nIf we had columns related to individual-level characteristics or alternative-level characteristics, we could include those in the model—and we'll do precisely that later in this post. (Incorporating individual-level covariates is the whole point of this post!)\n\nLet's fit the model:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_chocolate_mlogit <- mlogit(\n  choice ~ dark + soft + nuts | 0 | 0, \n  data = chocolate_idx\n)\n\nmodel_parameters(model_chocolate_mlogit, digits = 4, p_digits = 4)\n## Parameter   | Log-Odds |     SE |             95% CI |       z |      p\n## -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n## dark [Dark] |   1.3863 | 0.7906 | [-0.1632,  2.9358] |  1.7535 | 0.0795\n## soft [Soft] |  -2.1972 | 1.0541 | [-4.2632, -0.1312] | -2.0845 | 0.0371\n## nuts [Nuts] |   0.8473 | 0.6901 | [-0.5052,  2.1998] |  1.2279 | 0.2195\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nDelightful. All the results are the same as the survival model and the Poisson model.\n\n### `mclogit` model\n\n[As noted earlier](#mclogit-note), {marginaleffects} doesn't support `mlogit()` because of its weird internal structure. It *does* support `mclogit::mclogit()` though.\n\nThe syntax requires two parts on the left-hand side of the formula: (1) the choice selected (0 or 1), and (2) a unique id for set of choices, or the question. In this case, since each subject only saw one question, the `subj` column doubles as the question ID, so we can just use that.\n\nThe results are the same:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mclogit)\n\nmodel_chocolate_mclogit <- mclogit(\n  choice | subj ~ dark + soft + nuts,\n  data = chocolate\n)\n## \n## Iteration 1 - deviance = 29.16 - criterion = 0.1735\n## Iteration 2 - deviance = 28.74 - criterion = 0.01449\n## Iteration 3 - deviance = 28.73 - criterion = 0.0003555\n## Iteration 4 - deviance = 28.73 - criterion = 5.523e-07\n## Iteration 5 - deviance = 28.73 - criterion = 1.554e-12\n## converged\nmodel_parameters(model_chocolate_mclogit, digits = 4, p_digits = 4)\n## Parameter   | Log-Odds |     SE |             95% CI |       z |      p\n## -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n## dark [Dark] |   1.3863 | 0.7906 | [-0.1632,  2.9358] |  1.7535 | 0.0795\n## soft [Soft] |  -2.1972 | 1.0541 | [-4.2632, -0.1312] | -2.0845 | 0.0371\n## nuts [Nuts] |   0.8473 | 0.6901 | [-0.5052,  2.1998] |  1.2279 | 0.2195\n## \n## Uncertainty intervals (equal-tailed) and p-values (two-tailed) computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Bayesian model\n\nWe can also fit this model in a Bayesian way using {brms}. Stan has a categorical distribution family for multinomial models, and we'll use it in the next example. For now, for the sake of simplicity, we'll use a Poisson family, since, as we saw above, that's a legal way of parameterizing multinomial distributions.\n\nThe data has a natural hierarchical structure to it, with 8 choices (for alternatives A through H) nested inside each of the 10 subjects.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Multilevel experimental structure, with candy choices $y_{\\text{A}\\dots\\text{H}}$ nested in subjects](index_files/figure-html/chocolate-multilevel-structure-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe want to model candy choice (`choice`) based on candy characteristics (`dark`, `soft`, and `nuts`). We'll use the subscript $i$ to refer to individual candy choices and $j$ to refer to subjects. \n\nSince we can legally pretend that this multinomial selection process is actually Poisson, we'll model it as a Poisson process that has a rate of $\\lambda_{i_j}$. We'll model that $\\lambda_{i_j}$ with a log-linked regression model with covariates for each of the levels of each candy feature. To account for the multilevel structure, we'll include subject-specific offsets ($b_{0_j}$) from the global average, thus creating random intercepts. We'll specify fairly wide priors just because.\n\nHere's the formal model for all this:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\ \\textbf{Probability of selection of alternative}_i \\textbf{ in subject}_j \\\\\n\\text{Choice}_{i_j} \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Poisson}(\\lambda_{i_j}) \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Model for probability of each option} \\\\\n\\log(\\lambda_{i_j}) =&\\ (\\beta_0 + b_{0_j}) + \\beta_1 \\text{Dark}_{i_j} + \\beta_2 \\text{Soft}_{i_j} + \\beta_3 \\text{Nuts}_{i_j} \\\\[5pt]\nb_{0_j} \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_0) \\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\text{Subject-specific offsets from global choice probability} \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Priors} \\\\\n\\beta_0 \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N}(0, 3) \\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\ \\ \\text{Prior for global average choice probability} \\\\\n\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3 \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N}(0, 3) \\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\ \\ \\text{Prior for candy feature levels} \\\\\n\\sigma_0 \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\qquad \\text{Prior for between-subject variability}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnd here's the {brms} model:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_chocolate_brms <- brm(\n  bf(choice ~ dark + soft + nuts + (1 | subj)),\n  data = chocolate,\n  family = poisson(),\n  prior = c(\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = Intercept),\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = b),\n    prior(exponential(1), class = sd)\n  ),\n  chains = 4, cores = 4, iter = 2000, seed = 1234,\n  backend = \"cmdstanr\", threads = threading(2), refresh = 0,\n  file = \"models/model_chocolate_brms\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe results are roughly the same as what we found with all the other models—they're slightly off because of random MCMC sampling.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_parameters(model_chocolate_brms)\n## Running MCMC with 4 sequential chains, with 2 thread(s) per chain...\n## \n## Chain 1 finished in 0.1 seconds.\n## Chain 2 finished in 0.1 seconds.\n## Chain 3 finished in 0.1 seconds.\n## Chain 4 finished in 0.1 seconds.\n## \n## All 4 chains finished successfully.\n## Mean chain execution time: 0.1 seconds.\n## Total execution time: 1.0 seconds.\n## # Fixed Effects\n## \n## Parameter   | Median |         95% CI |     pd |  Rhat |     ESS\n## ----------------------------------------------------------------\n## (Intercept) |  -3.04 | [-5.07, -1.60] |   100% | 1.000 | 3598.00\n## darkDark    |   1.35 | [-0.05,  3.16] | 96.92% | 1.000 | 4238.00\n## softSoft    |  -2.03 | [-4.35, -0.47] | 99.60% | 1.000 | 2867.00\n## nutsNuts    |   0.83 | [-0.40,  2.27] | 90.28% | 1.000 | 4648.00\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Predictions\n\nIn the SAS technical note example, they use the model to generated predicted probabilities of the choice of each of the options. In the world of marketing, this can also be seen as the predicted market share for each option. To do this, they plug each of the eight different different combinations of dark, soft, and nuts into the model and calculate the predicted output on the response (i.e. probability) scale. They get these results, where dark, chewy, and nuts is the most likely and popular option (commanding a 50% market share). \n\n```default\n      Choice of Chocolate Candies\n\nObs    Dark    Soft     Nuts       p\n\n  1    Dark    Chewy    Nuts       0.50400\n  2    Dark    Chewy    No Nuts    0.21600\n  3    Milk    Chewy    Nuts       0.12600\n  4    Dark    Soft     Nuts       0.05600\n  5    Milk    Chewy    No Nuts    0.05400\n  6    Dark    Soft     No Nuts    0.02400\n  7    Milk    Soft     Nuts       0.01400\n  8    Milk    Soft     No Nuts    0.00600\n```\n\nWe can do the same thing with R. \n\n### Frequentist predictions\n\n~~{mlogit} model objects have predicted values stored in one of their slots (`model_chocolate_mlogit$probabilities`), but they're in a weird non-tidy matrix form and I like working with tidy data. I'm also a huge fan of [the {marginaleffects} package](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/), which provides a consistent way to calculate predictions, comparisons, and slopes/marginal effects (with `predictions()`, `comparisons()`, and `slopes()`) for dozens of kinds of models, including `mlogit()` models. So instead of wrangling the built-in `mlogit()` probabilities, we'll generate predictions by feeding the model the unique combinations of `dark`, `soft`, and `nuts` to `marginaleffects::predictions()`, which will provide us with probability- or proportion-scale predictions:~~\n\nWe can calculate probability-scale predictions by feeding the alternatives A–H (or the unique combinations of `dark`, `soft`, and `nuts`) to the model using `predict()`. We have to first create a little dataset of the alternatives (here I filter the data to include only Subject 1), and then feed that to `predict()`, which returns a named vector. To get that into a more usable data frame, we can convert the named vector into a data frame with `tidyr::enframe()` and then join it to the data frame of alternatives:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Unique combinations of dark, soft, and nuts across the 8 alternatives\nalts <- chocolate %>% \n  filter(subj == 1) %>% \n  select(-subj, -choice)\n\n# Named vector of predicted values\npreds <- predict(model_chocolate_mlogit, newdata = alts)\n\npreds_chocolate_mlogit <- alts %>% \n  left_join(enframe(preds, name = \"alt\", value = \"estimate\"), by = join_by(alt)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(estimate))\npreds_chocolate_mlogit\n## # A tibble: 8 × 5\n##   alt   dark  soft  nuts    estimate\n##   <chr> <fct> <fct> <fct>      <dbl>\n## 1 F     Dark  Chewy Nuts     0.504  \n## 2 E     Dark  Chewy No nuts  0.216  \n## 3 B     Milk  Chewy Nuts     0.126  \n## 4 H     Dark  Soft  Nuts     0.0560 \n## 5 A     Milk  Chewy No nuts  0.0540 \n## 6 G     Dark  Soft  No nuts  0.0240 \n## 7 D     Milk  Soft  Nuts     0.0140 \n## 8 C     Milk  Soft  No nuts  0.00600\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPerfect! They're identical to the SAS output. \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n### jklol they're not perfect\n\nAs far as I can tell, `predict()` doesn't provide standard errors for `mlogit()`-based models, and none of the more standard helper packages like `marginaleffects::predictions()` or `broom::agument()` really do either. I guess that's good incentive to do this with Bayesian methods instead :)\n:::\n\nWe can play around with these predictions to describe the overall market for candy.

[I have a whole other blog post guide about this](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/11/29/conditional-marginal-marginaleffects/#summary) and how absolutely maddening the nomenclature for all this is.\n\nBy default, `predictions()` and friends will calculate predictions for subjects on average by using the `re_formula = NULL` argument. This estimate includes details from the random offsets, either by integrating them out or by using the mean and standard deviation of the random offsets to generate a simulated average subject. When working with slopes, this is also called a *marginal effect*.\n\nWe could also use `re_formula = NA` to calculate predictions for a typical subject, or a subject where the random offset is set to 0. When working with slopes, this is also called a *conditional effect*.\n\n- Conditional predictions/effect = average subject = `re_formula = NA`\n- Marginal predictions/effect = subjects on average = `re_formula = NULL` (default), using existing subject levels or a new simulated subject\n\nAgain, [see this guide for way more about these distinctions](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/11/29/conditional-marginal-marginaleffects). In this example here, we'll just use the default marginal predictions/effects (`re_formula = NULL`), or the effect for subjects on average.\n:::\n\nThe predicted proportions aren't identical to the SAS output, but they're close enough, given that it's a completely different modeling approach.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npreds_chocolate_brms <- predictions(\n  model_chocolate_brms, \n  newdata = datagrid(dark = unique, soft = unique, nuts = unique)\n) \n\npreds_chocolate_brms %>% \n  as_tibble() %>%\n  arrange(desc(estimate)) %>% \n  select(dark, soft, nuts, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\n## # A tibble: 8 × 6\n##   dark  soft  nuts    estimate conf.low conf.high\n##   <fct> <fct> <fct>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n## 1 Dark  Chewy Nuts     0.432   0.144       1.09  \n## 2 Dark  Chewy No nuts  0.186   0.0424      0.571 \n## 3 Milk  Chewy Nuts     0.110   0.0168      0.419 \n## 4 Dark  Soft  Nuts     0.0553  0.00519     0.279 \n## 5 Milk  Chewy No nuts  0.0465  0.00552     0.219 \n## 6 Dark  Soft  No nuts  0.0230  0.00182     0.141 \n## 7 Milk  Soft  Nuts     0.0136  0.00104     0.0881\n## 8 Milk  Soft  No nuts  0.00556 0.000326    0.0414\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Plots\n\nSince `predictions()` returns a tidy data frame, we can plot these predicted probabilities (or market shares or however we want to think about them) with {ggplot2}:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 <- preds_chocolate_mlogit %>% \n  arrange(estimate) %>% \n  mutate(label = str_to_sentence(glue::glue(\"{dark} chocolate, {soft} interior, {nuts}\"))) %>% \n  mutate(label = fct_inorder(label)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = label)) +\n  geom_point(color = clrs[7]) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Predicted probability of selection\", y = NULL,\n    title = \"Frequentist {mlogit} predictions\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())\n\np2 <- preds_chocolate_brms %>% \n  posterior_draws() %>%  # Extract the posterior draws of the predictions\n  arrange(estimate) %>% \n  mutate(label = str_to_sentence(glue::glue(\"{dark} chocolate, {soft} interior, {nuts}\"))) %>% \n  mutate(label = fct_inorder(label)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = draw, y = label)) +\n  stat_halfeye(normalize = \"xy\", fill = clrs[7])  +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Predicted probability of selection\", y = NULL,\n    title = \"Bayesian {brms} predictions\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +\n  # Make the x-axis match the mlogit plot\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.05, 0.78))\n\np1 / p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-preds-chocolate-1.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## AMCEs\n\nThe marketing world doesn't typically look at coefficients or marginal effects, but the political science world definitely does. In political science, the estimand we often care about the most is the average marginal component effect (AMCE), or the causal effect of moving one feature level to a different value, holding all other features constant. [I have a whole in-depth blog post about AMCEs and how to calculate them](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2023/07/25/conjoint-bayesian-frequentist-guide/)—go look at that for more details. Long story short—AMCEs are basically the coefficients in a regression model.\n\nInterpreting the coefficients is difficult with models that aren't basic linear regression. Here, all these coefficients are on the log scale, so they're not directly interpretable. The original SAS technical note also doesn't really interpret any of these , they don't really interpret these things anyway, since they're more focused on predictions. All they say is this:\n\n> The parameter estimate with the smallest *p*-value is for soft center. Since the parameter estimate is negative, chewy is the more preferred level. Dark is preferred over milk, and nuts over no nuts, however only the *p*-value for Soft is less than 0.05.\n\nWe could exponentiate the coefficients to make them multiplicative (akin to odds ratios in logistic regression). For center = soft, $e^{-2.19722}$ = 0.1111, which means that candies with a soft center are 89% less likely to be chosen than candies with a chewy center, relative to the average candy. But that's weird to think about.\n\nSo instead we can turn to {marginaleffects} once again to calculate percentage-point scale estimands that we can interpret far more easily.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n#### lol marginal effects\n\nNobody is ever consistent about the word \"marginal effect.\" Some people use it to refer to averages; some people use it to refer to slopes. These are complete opposites. In calculus, averages = integrals and slopes = derivatives and they're the inverse of each other.\n\nI like to think of marginal effects as what happens to the outcome when you move an explanatory variable a tiny bit. With continuous variables, that's a slope; with categorical variables, that's an offset in average outcomes. These correspond directly to how you normally interpret regression coefficients. Or returning to [my favorite analogy about regression](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/#regression-sliders-switches-and-mixing-boards), with numeric variables we care what happens to the outcome when we slide the value up a tiny bit; with categorical variables we care about what happens to the outcome when we switch on a category.\n\nAdditionally, there are like a billion different ways to calculate marginal effects: average marginal effects (AMEs), group-average marginal effects (G-AMEs), marginal effects at user-specified values, marginal effects at the mean (MEM), and counterfactual marginal effects. See [the documentation for {marginaleffects}](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/slopes.html) + [this mega blog post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/) for more about these subtle differences.\n:::\n\n### Bayesian comparisons/contrasts\n\nWe can use `avg_comparisons()` to calculate the difference (or average marginal effect) for each of the categorical coefficients on the percentage-point scale, showing the effect of moving from milk → dark, chewy → soft, and nuts → no nuts.\n\n(Technically we can also use `avg_slopes()`, even though none of these coefficients are actually slopes. {marginaleffects} is smart enough to show contrasts for categorical variables and partial derivatives/slopes for continuous variables.)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\navg_comparisons(model_chocolate_brms)\n## \n##  Term                   Contrast Estimate    2.5 %  97.5 %\n##  dark mean(Dark) - mean(Milk)       0.139 -0.00551  0.3211\n##  nuts mean(Nuts) - mean(No nuts)    0.092 -0.05221  0.2599\n##  soft mean(Soft) - mean(Chewy)     -0.182 -0.35800 -0.0523\n## \n## Type:  response \n## Columns: term, contrast, estimate, conf.low, conf.high, predicted_lo, predicted_hi, predicted, tmp_idx\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen holding all other features constant, moving from chewy → soft is associated with a posterior median 18 percentage point decrease in the probability of selection (or drop in market share if you want to think of it that way), on average.\n\n### Frequentist comparisons/contrasts\n\nWe went out of order in this section and showed how to use `avg_comparisons()` with the Bayesian model first instead of the frequentist model. That's because it was easy. \n\n`mlogit()` models don't work with {marignaleffects} (or other model wrangling packages like {broom}), so there's no good way to do it. We're limited to calculating the contrasts of predictions by hand and manipulating and collapsing the data frame of predictions that we made previously.\n\nIt's helpful to illustrate what exactly we're looking at when collapsing these results. Remember that earlier we calculated predictions for all the unique combinations of `dark`, `soft`, and `nuts`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Unique combinations of dark, soft, and nuts across the 8 alternatives\nalts <- chocolate %>% \n  filter(subj == 1) %>% \n  select(-subj, -choice)\n\n# Named vector of predicted values\npreds <- predict(model_chocolate_mlogit, newdata = alts, se.fit = TRUE)\n\npreds_chocolate_mlogit <- alts %>% \n  left_join(enframe(preds, name = \"alt\", value = \"estimate\"), by = join_by(alt)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(estimate))\npreds_chocolate_mlogit\n## # A tibble: 8 × 5\n##   alt   dark  soft  nuts    estimate\n##   <chr> <fct> <fct> <fct>      <dbl>\n## 1 F     Dark  Chewy Nuts     0.504  \n## 2 E     Dark  Chewy No nuts  0.216  \n## 3 B     Milk  Chewy Nuts     0.126  \n## 4 H     Dark  Soft  Nuts     0.0560 \n## 5 A     Milk  Chewy No nuts  0.0540 \n## 6 G     Dark  Soft  No nuts  0.0240 \n## 7 D     Milk  Soft  Nuts     0.0140 \n## 8 C     Milk  Soft  No nuts  0.00600\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFour of the groups have `dark` = Milk and four have `dark` = Dark, with other varying characteristics across those groups (chewy/soft, nuts/no nuts).

There were 200 respondents, with 45 rows each, so there are 200 × 45 = 9,000 rows. Here, Respondent 1 chose a \\$30,000 gas van with 6 seats and 3 feet of cargo space in the first set of three options, a \\$35,000 gas van with 7 seats and 3 feet of cargo space in the second set of three options, and so on. \n\nThere's also a column here for `carpool` indicating if the respondent carpools with others when commuting. It's an individual respondent-level characteristic and is constant throughout all the questions and alternatives, and we'll use it later.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nminivans\n## # A tibble: 9,000 × 9\n##    resp.id  ques   alt carpool seat  cargo eng   price choice\n##      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <fct>   <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct>  <dbl>\n##  1       1     1     1 yes     6     2ft   gas   35         0\n##  2       1     1     2 yes     8     3ft   hyb   30         0\n##  3       1     1     3 yes     6     3ft   gas   30         1\n##  4       1     2     1 yes     6     2ft   gas   30         0\n##  5       1     2     2 yes     7     3ft   gas   35         1\n##  6       1     2     3 yes     6     2ft   elec  35         0\n##  7       1     3     1 yes     8     3ft   gas   35         1\n##  8       1     3     2 yes     7     3ft   elec  30         0\n##  9       1     3     3 yes     8     2ft   elec  40         0\n## 10       1     4     1 yes     7     3ft   elec  40         1\n## # ℹ 8,990 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## The model\n\nRespondents were shown three different options and asked to select one. We thus have three possible outcomes: a respondent could have selected option 1, option 2, or option 3. Because everything was randomized, there shouldn't be any patterns in which options people choose—we don't want to see that the first column is more common, since that would indicate that respondents are just repeatedly selecting the first column to get through the survey. Since there are three possible outcomes (option 1, 2, and 3), we'll use multinomial logistic regression.\n\n### Original model as a baseline\n\nIn the example in their textbook, @ChapmanFeit:2019 use {mlogit} to estimate this model and they find these results. This will be our baseline throughout this example.\n\n![Original results from @ChapmanFeit:2019 p. 371](img/chapman-feit-mlogit.png)\n\n### `mlogit` model\n\nThis data is a little more complex now, since there are alternatives nested inside questions inside respondents. To account for this panel structure when using {mlogit}, we need to define two index columns: one for the unique set of alternatives offered to the respondent and one for the respondent ID. We still do this with `dfidx()`, but need to create a new column with an ID number for each unique combination of respondent ID and question number:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nminivans_idx <- minivans %>% \n  # mlogit() needs a column with unique question id numbers\n  group_by(resp.id, ques) %>% \n  mutate(choice.id = cur_group_id()) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  # Make indexed data frame for mlogit\n  dfidx(\n    idx = list(c(\"choice.id\", \"resp.id\"), \"alt\"),\n    choice = \"choice\",\n    shape = \"long\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we can fit the model. Note the `0 ~ seat` syntax here. That suppresses the intercept for the model, which behaves weirdly with multinomial models. Since there are three categories for the outcome (options 1, 2, and 3), there are two intercepts, representing cutpoints-from-ordered-logit-esque shifts in the probability of selecting option 1 vs. option 2 and option 2 vs. option 3. We don't want to deal with those, so we'll suppress them. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_minivans_mlogit <- mlogit(\n  choice ~ 0 + seat + cargo + eng + price | 0 | 0, \n  data = minivans_idx\n)\nmodel_parameters(model_minivans_mlogit, digits = 4, p_digits = 4)\n## Parameter   | Log-Odds |     SE |             95% CI |        z |           p\n## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## seat [7]    |  -0.5353 | 0.0624 | [-0.6575, -0.4131] |  -8.5837 | 9.1863e-18 \n## seat [8]    |  -0.3058 | 0.0611 | [-0.4256, -0.1860] |  -5.0032 | 5.6376e-07 \n## cargo [3ft] |   0.4774 | 0.0509 | [ 0.3777,  0.5772] |   9.3824 | 6.4514e-21 \n## eng [hyb]   |  -0.8113 | 0.0601 | [-0.9291, -0.6934] | -13.4921 | 1.7408e-41 \n## eng [elec]  |  -1.5308 | 0.0675 | [-1.6630, -1.3985] | -22.6926 | 5.3004e-114\n## price [35]  |  -0.9137 | 0.0606 | [-1.0324, -0.7949] | -15.0765 | 2.3123e-51 \n## price [40]  |  -1.7259 | 0.0696 | [-1.8623, -1.5894] | -24.7856 | 1.2829e-135\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThese are the same results from p. 371 in @ChapmanFeit:2019, so it worked. Again, the marketing world doesn't typically do much with these coefficients beyond looking at their direction and magnitude. For instance, in @ChapmanFeit:2019 they say that the estimate for `seat [7]` here is negative, which means that a 7-seat option is less preferred than 6-seat option, and that the estimate for `price [40]` is more negative than the already-negative estimate for `price [35]`, which means that (1) respondents don't like the \\$35,000 option compared to the baseline \\$30,000 and that (2) respondents *really* don't like the \\$40,000 option. We could theoretically exponentiate these things—like, seeing 7 seats makes it $e^{-0.5353}$ = 0.5855 = 41% less likely to select the option compared to 6 seats—but again, that's weird.\n\n\n### `mclogit` model\n\n[As noted earlier](#mclogit-note), {marginaleffects} doesn't support `mlogit()` because of its weird internal structure. It *does* support `mclogit::mclogit()` though.\n\nThe syntax requires two parts on the left-hand side of the formula: (1) the choice selected (0 or 1), and (2) a unique id for set of choices, or the question.

Stan has a categorical family for dealing with mulitnomial/categorical outcomes. But first, we'll look at the nested structure of this data and incorporate that into the model, since we won't be using the weird {mlogit}-style indexed data frame. As with the chocolate experiment, the data has a natural hierarchy in it, with three questions nested inside 15 separate question sets, nested inside each of the 200 respondents.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Multilevel experimental structure, with minivan choices $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$ nested in sets of questions in respondents](index_files/figure-html/minivan-multilevel-structure-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nCurrently, our main outcome variable `choice` is binary. If we run the model with `choice` as the outcome with a categorical family, the model will fit, but it will go slow and {brms} will complain about it and recommend switching to regular logistic regression. The categorical family in Stan requires 2+ outcomes and a reference category. Here we have three possible options (1, 2, and 3), and we can imagine a reference category of 0 for rows that weren't selected. \n\nWe can create a new outcome column (`choice_alt`) that indicates which option each respondent selected: 0 if they didn't choose the option and 1–3 if they chose the first, second, or third option. Because of how the data is recorded, this only requires multiplying `alt` and `choice`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nminivans_choice_alt <- minivans %>% \n  mutate(choice_alt = factor(alt * choice))\n\nminivans_choice_alt %>% \n  select(resp.id, ques, alt, seat, cargo, eng, price, choice, choice_alt)\n## # A tibble: 9,000 × 9\n##    resp.id  ques   alt seat  cargo eng   price choice choice_alt\n##      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct>  <dbl> <fct>     \n##  1       1     1     1 6     2ft   gas   35         0 0         \n##  2       1     1     2 8     3ft   hyb   30         0 0         \n##  3       1     1     3 6     3ft   gas   30         1 3         \n##  4       1     2     1 6     2ft   gas   30         0 0         \n##  5       1     2     2 7     3ft   gas   35         1 2         \n##  6       1     2     3 6     2ft   elec  35         0 0         \n##  7       1     3     1 8     3ft   gas   35         1 1         \n##  8       1     3     2 7     3ft   elec  30         0 0         \n##  9       1     3     3 8     2ft   elec  40         0 0         \n## 10       1     4     1 7     3ft   elec  40         1 1         \n## # ℹ 8,990 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can now use the new four-category `choice_alt` column as our outcome with the `categorical()` family. \n\nIf we *realllly* wanted, we could add random effects for question sets nested inside respondents, like `(1 | resp.id / ques)`. We'd want to do that if there were set-specific things that could influences choices. Like maybe we want to account for the possibility that everyone's just choosing the first option, so it behaves differently? Or maybe the 5th set of questions is set to an extra difficult level on a quiz or something? Or maybe we have so many sets that we think the later ones will be less accurate because of respondent fatigue? idk. In this case, question set-specific effects don't matter at all. Each question set is equally randomized and no different from the others, so we won't bother modeling that layer of the hierarchy.\n\nWe want to model the choice of option 1, 2, or 3 (`choice_alt`) based on minivan characteristics (`seat`, `cargo`, `eng`, price). With the categorical model, we actually get a set of parameters to estimate the probability of selecting each of the options, which Stan calls $\\mu$, so we have a set of three probabilities: $\\{\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3\\}$. We'll use the subscript $i$ to refer to individual minivan choices and $j$ to refer to respondents. Here's the fun formal model:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\ \\textbf{Multinomial probability of selection of choice}_i \\textbf{ in respondent}_j \\\\\n\\text{Choice}_{i_j} \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\{\\mu_{1,i_j}, \\mu_{2,i_j}, \\mu_{3,i_j}\\}) \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Model for probability of each option} \\\\\n\\{\\mu_{1,i_j}, \\mu_{2,i_j}, \\mu_{3,i_j}\\} =&\\ (\\beta_0 + b_{0_j}) + \\beta_1 \\text{Seat[7]}_{i_j} + \\beta_2 \\text{Seat[8]}_{i_j} + \\beta_3 \\text{Cargo[3ft]}_{i_j} + \\\\\n&\\ \\beta_4 \\text{Engine[hyb]}_{i_j} + \\beta_5 \\text{Engine[elec]}_{i_j} + \\beta_6 \\text{Price[35k]}_{i_j} + \\beta_7 \\text{Price[40k]}_{i_j} \\\\[5pt]\nb_{0_j} \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_0) \\qquad\\quad\\quad \\text{Respondent-specific offsets from global probability} \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Priors} \\\\\n\\beta_{0 \\dots 7} \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N} (0, 3) \\qquad\\qquad\\ \\ \\text{Prior for choice-level coefficients} \\\\\n\\sigma_0 \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\quad \\text{Prior for between-respondent variability}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnd here's the {brms} model. Notice the much-more-verbose prior section—because the categorical family in Stan estimates separate parameters for each of the categories ($\\{\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3\\}$), we have a mean and standard deviation for the probability of selecting each of those options. We need to specify each of these separately too instead of just doing something like `prior(normal(0, 3), class = b)`. Also notice the `refcat` argument in `categorical()`—this makes it so that all the estimates are relative to not choosing an option (or when `choice_alt` is 0). And *also* notice the slightly different syntax for the random respondent intercepts: `(1 | ID | resp.id)`. That new middle `ID` is special {brms} formula syntax that we can use when working with categorical or ordinal families, and it makes it so that the group-level effects for the different outcomes (here options 0, 1, 2, and 3) are correlated (see p. 4 of [this {brms} vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf) for more about this special syntax).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_minivans_categorical_brms <- brm(\n  bf(choice_alt ~ 0 + seat + cargo + eng + price + (1 | ID | resp.id)),\n  data = minivans_choice_alt,\n  family = categorical(refcat = \"0\"),\n  prior = c(\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = b, dpar = mu1),\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = b, dpar = mu2),\n    prior(normal(0, 3), class = b, dpar = mu3),\n    prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = mu1),\n    prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = mu2),\n    prior(exponential(1), class = sd, dpar = mu3)\n  ),\n  chains = 4, cores = 4, iter = 2000, seed = 1234,\n  backend = \"cmdstanr\", threads = threading(2), refresh = 0,\n  file = \"models/model_minivans_categorical_brms\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model gives us a ton of parameters!

To do this we'll take the average of each of the three $\\mu$ estimates within each draw, which is also called \"marginalizing\" across the three options.\n\nHere's how we'd do that with {tidybayes}.

It's a lot trickier with the minivan example where respondents were shown 15 sets of 3 options. Dealing with multinomial predictions is a bear of a task because these models are a lot more complex. \n\n### Frequentist predictions\n\nWith the chocolate model, we could use `predict(model_chocolate_mlogit)` and automatically get predictions for all 8 options.

That's because respondents were presented with three randomly shuffled options and chose one of them. All these predictions tell us is that across all 15 iterations of the questions, 1/3 of respondents selected the first option, 1/3 the second, and 1/3 the third. That's a good sign in this case—there's no evidence that people were just repeatedly choosing the first option. But in the end, these predictions aren't super useful.\n\nWe instead want to be able to get predicted market shares (or predicted probabilities) for any given mix of products. For instance, here are six arbitrary hypothetical products with different combinations of seats, cargo space, engines, and prices:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_product_mix <- tribble(\n  ~seat, ~cargo, ~eng, ~price,\n  \"7\", \"2ft\", \"hyb\", \"30\",\n  \"6\", \"2ft\", \"gas\", \"30\",\n  \"8\", \"2ft\", \"gas\", \"30\",\n  \"7\", \"3ft\", \"gas\", \"40\",\n  \"6\", \"2ft\", \"elec\", \"40\",\n  \"7\", \"2ft\", \"hyb\", \"35\"\n) %>% \n  mutate(across(everything(), factor)) %>% \n  mutate(eng = factor(eng, levels = levels(minivans$eng)))\nexample_product_mix\n## # A tibble: 6 × 4\n##   seat  cargo eng   price\n##   <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct>\n## 1 7     2ft   hyb   30   \n## 2 6     2ft   gas   30   \n## 3 8     2ft   gas   30   \n## 4 7     3ft   gas   40   \n## 5 6     2ft   elec  40   \n## 6 7     2ft   hyb   35\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf we were working with any other type of model, we could plug this data into the `newdata` argument of `predict()` and get predicted values. That doesn't work here though.

Holding all other features constant, what is the effect of a \\$5,000 increase in price or moving from 2 feet → 3 feet of storage space on the probability (or favorability) of selecting a minivan?\n\nIn the chocolate example, we were able to use `marginaleffects::avg_comparisons()` with the Bayesian model and get categorical contrasts automatically. This was because we cheated and used a Poisson model, since those can secretly behave like multinomial models. For the frequentist {mlogit}-based model, we had to use base R's `predict()` instead and then collapse the predictions into the different contrasts we were interested in using `group_by() %>% summarize()`. We need to do the same thing here.\n\n### Frequentist comparisons/contrasts\n\nTo help with the intuition behind this, since it's more complex this time, we'll create a data frame to show all the combinations of all the feature levels (3 seats × 2 cargos × 3 engines × 3 prices). There are 54 possible combinations:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvan_all_combos <- minivans %>% \n  tidyr::expand(seat, cargo, eng, price)\nvan_all_combos\n## # A tibble: 54 × 4\n##    seat  cargo eng   price\n##    <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct>\n##  1 6     2ft   gas   30   \n##  2 6     2ft   gas   35   \n##  3 6     2ft   gas   40   \n##  4 6     2ft   hyb   30   \n##  5 6     2ft   hyb   35   \n##  6 6     2ft   hyb   40   \n##  7 6     2ft   elec  30   \n##  8 6     2ft   elec  35   \n##  9 6     2ft   elec  40   \n## 10 6     3ft   gas   30   \n## # ℹ 44 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe want to calculate the probabilities for each of these combinations, regardless of whether the hypothetical minivan appeared as the first, second, or third option in the survey experiment.\n\nFortunately, {mlogit} already did most of the work for us!

We could theoretically work with things like `marginaleffects::comparisons()` or `marginaleffects::slopes()` to extract the AMCEs from the model, but as I'll show below, there are some weird mathy things we have to deal with because of the multinomial outcome, and I think it's beyond what {marginaleffects} is designed to easily do. \n\nSo instead we can use `epred_draws()` from {tidybayes} and calculate posterior predictions ourselves ([see this guide](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/09/26/guide-visualizing-types-posteriors/) for an overview of all of {tidybayes}'s different prediction functions).\n\nTo illustrate why predicting things with this multinomial model is so weird, we'll first predict the probability that someone chooses a \\$30,000 6-seater electric van with 2 feet of storage space. For this combination of minivan characteristics, there's a 66% chance that someone does not select it, shown as category 0. That means there's a 33% chance that someone *does* select it. Because options 1, 2 and 3 were randomized, that 33% is split evenly across categories 1, 2, and 3 in the predictions here.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_prediction <- model_minivans_categorical_brms %>% \n  epred_draws(newdata = data.frame(\n    seat = \"6\", cargo = \"2ft\", eng = \"elec\", price = \"30\", resp.id = 1)\n  )\n\none_prediction %>% \n  group_by(.category) %>% \n  median_qi(.epred)\n## # A tibble: 4 × 7\n##   .category .epred .lower .upper .width .point .interval\n##   <fct>      <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>    \n## 1 0          0.661 0.629   0.694   0.95 median qi       \n## 2 1          0.104 0.0843  0.128   0.95 median qi       \n## 3 2          0.112 0.0894  0.138   0.95 median qi       \n## 4 3          0.121 0.0990  0.147   0.95 median qi\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe could add the predictions for categories 1, 2, and 3 together, but that would take a bit of extra data manipulation work. Instead, we can rely on the the fact that the prediction for category 0 is actually the inverse of the sum of categories 1+2+3, so we can instead just use `1 - .epred` and only look at category 0. Even though the `category` column here says `0`, it's really the combined probability of choosing options 1, 2, or 3:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_prediction %>% \n  mutate(.epred = 1 - .epred) %>%\n  filter(.category == 0) %>% \n  median_qi(.epred)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 13\n##   seat  cargo eng   price resp.id  .row .category .epred .lower .upper .width .point .interval\n##   <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <dbl> <int> <fct>      <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>    \n## 1 6     2ft   elec  30          1     1 0          0.339  0.306  0.371   0.95 median qi\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWith {mlogit}, we found AMCEs by essentially calculating marginal means for specific contrasts of predicted probabilities.

All those peaks come from combining the 27 different 2ft- and 3ft- posterior distributions for all the different combinations of other feature levels. \n\nTo get the actual marginal mean for cargo space, we need to marginalize out (or average out) all those other covariates. To do this, we need to group by the `cargo` column *and* the `.draw` column so that we find the average within each set of MCMC draws. To help with the intuition, look how many rows are in each of these groups of `cargo` and `.draw`—there are 27 different estimates for each of the 4,000 draws for 2 feet and 27 different estimates for each of the 4,000 draws for 3 feet.

This was because these datasets had a natural panel grouping structure inside them. {mlogit} can work with panel-indexed data frames (that's the point of that strange `dfidx()` function). By creating respondent-specific intercepts like we did with the {brms} models, we helped account for some of the variation caused by respondent differences.\n\nBut we can do better than that and get far richer and more complex models and estimates and predictions. In addition to using respondent-specific intercepts, we can (1) include respondent-level characteristics as covariates, and (2) include respondent-specific slopes for the minivan characteristic.\n\nIn the minivan data, we have data on feature levels (`seat`, `cargo`, `eng`, `price`) *and* on individual characteristics (`carpool`). The `carpool` variable indicates if the respondent uses their vehicle for carpooling. This is measured at the respondent level and not the choice level (i.e. someone won't stop being a carpooler during one set of choices and then resume being a carpooler for another set). \nWe can visualize where these different columns are measured by returning to the hierarchical model diagram:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Multilevel experimental structure, with minivan choices $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$ nested in sets of questions in respondents, w ith variables measured at different levels](index_files/figure-html/minivan-multilevel-structure-annotated-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can use hierarchical models (or multilevel models, or mixed effects models, or whatever you want to call them) to account for choice-level and respondent-level covariates *and* incorporate respondent-level heterogeneity and covariance into the model estimates.\n\n![Image by [Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti](https://twitter.com/chelseaparlett/status/1458461737431146500)](img/chelsea-meme.jpg){width=50%}\n\n## Important sidenote on notation\n\nBut before looking at how to incorporate that `carpool` column into the model, we need to take a quick little detour into the world of notation. There's no consistent way of writing out multilevel models,^[These are not the only approaches—section 12.5 in @GelmanHill:2007 is called \"Five ways to write the same model,\" and they don't include the offset notation as one of their five!] and accordingly, I thought it was impossible to run fully specified marketing-style hierarchical Bayesian models with {brms}—all because of notation!\n\nThere are a couple general ways I've seen group-level random effects written out in formal model notation: one with complete random β terms and one with random offsets from a global β term.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### {brms} / {lme4} syntax\n\nFor the best overview of how to use {brms} and {lme4} with different random group-level intercept and slope specifications, [check out this summary table by Ben Bolker](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#model-specification).\n:::\n\n### Random intercepts\n\nIf you want group-specific intercept terms, you can use a formula like this:\n\n``` r\nbf(y ~ x + (1 | group))\n```\n\nIn formal mathy terms, we can write this group-specific intercept as a complete coefficient: $\\beta_{0_j}$. Each group $j$ gets its own intercept coefficient. Nice and straightforward.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i_j} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{i_j}, \\sigma_y) & \\text{Outcome for individual}_i \\text{ within group}_j \\\\\n\\mu_{i_j} &= \\beta_{0_j} + \\beta_1 X_{i_j} & \\text{Linear model of within-group variation } \\\\\n\\beta_{0_j} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_0, \\sigma_0) & \\text{Random group-specific intercepts}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHowever, I actually like to think of these random effects in a slightly different way, where each group intercept is actually a combination of a global average ($\\beta_0$) and a group-specific offset from that average ($b_{0_j}$), like this:\n\n$$\n\\beta_{0_j} = \\beta_0 + b_{0_j}\n$$\n\nThat offset is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 ($\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_0)$):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i_j} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{i_j}, \\sigma_y) & \\text{Outcome for individual}_i \\text{ within group}_j \\\\\n\\mu_{i_j} &= (b_{0_j} + \\beta_0) + \\beta_1 X_{i_j} & \\text{Linear model of within-group variation } \\\\\nb_{0_j} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_0) & \\text{Random group-specific offsets from global intercept}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nI prefer this offset notation because it aligns with the output of {brms}, which reports population-level coefficients (i.e. the global average $\\beta_0$) along with group-specific offsets from that average (i.e. $b_{0_j}$), which you can access with `ranef(model_name)`.\n\n\n### Random slopes\n\nIf you want group-specific intercepts *and* slopes, you can use a formula like this:\n\n``` r\nbf(y ~ x + (1 + x | group))\n```\n\nThe same dual syntax applies when using random slopes too. We can either use whole group-specific $\\beta_{n_j}$ terms, or use offsets ($b_{n_j}$) from a global average slope ($\\beta_n$). When working with random slopes, the math notation gets a little fancier because the random intercept and slope terms are actually correlated and move together across groups. The $\\beta$ terms come from a multivariate (or joint) normal distribution with shared covariance. \n\nWith the complete β approach, we're estimating the joint distribution of $\\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_{0_j} \\\\ \\beta_{1_j} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n\n::: {.column-page-inset}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{i_j} &\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{i_j}, \\sigma_y) & \\text{Outcome for individual}_i \\text{

I've seen that use hierarchical Bayesian models—and even one I coauthored! [@ChaudhryDotsonHeiss:2021] ([see the appendix](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/who-cares-about-crackdowns/output/appendix.html#model-details))—they define their models using notation like this:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Choice} &\\sim \\operatorname{Multinomial\\ logit}(\\beta X) & \\text{where } X = \\text{feature levels} \\\\\n\\beta &\\sim \\operatorname{Multivariate} \\mathcal{N}(\\gamma Z, \\Sigma) & \\text{where } Z = \\text{individual characteristics}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor the longest time this threw me off because it's slightly different from the two different notations we just reviewed (full βs vs. offsets from global β), and I figured that specifying a model like this with {brms} was impossible. The main reason for my confusion is that there are two different datasets involved in this model, and {brms} can only really work with one dataset. \n\nIn raw Stan (like [in this tutorial on conjoint hierarchical Bayes models](https://github.com/ksvanhorn/ART-Forum-2017-Stan-Tutorial), or in [this example of a different conjoint hierarchical model](https://github.com/Bartosz-G/Conjoint-Analysis-in-R/)), you'd typically work with two different datasets or matrices: one $X$ with feature levels and one $Z$ with respondent-level characteristics. ([This is actually the recommended way to write hierarchical models in raw Stan!](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/multivariate-hierarchical-priors.html)).\n\nHere's what separate $X$ and $Z$ matrices would look like with the minivan data—`X` contains the full data without respondent-level covariates like `carpool` and it has 9,000 rows; `Z` contains only respondent-level characteristics like `carpool` and it only has 200 rows (one per respondent).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX <- minivans %>% select(-carpool)\nX\n## # A tibble: 9,000 × 8\n##    resp.id  ques   alt seat  cargo eng   price choice\n##      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct>  <dbl>\n##  1       1     1     1 6     2ft   gas   35         0\n##  2       1     1     2 8     3ft   hyb   30         0\n##  3       1     1     3 6     3ft   gas   30         1\n##  4       1     2     1 6     2ft   gas   30         0\n##  5       1     2     2 7     3ft   gas   35         1\n##  6       1     2     3 6     2ft   elec  35         0\n##  7       1     3     1 8     3ft   gas   35         1\n##  8       1     3     2 7     3ft   elec  30         0\n##  9       1     3     3 8     2ft   elec  40         0\n## 10       1     4     1 7     3ft   elec  40         1\n## # ℹ 8,990 more rows\n\nZ <- minivans %>% \n  # Only keep the first row of each respondent\n  group_by(resp.id) %>% slice(1) %>% ungroup() %>% \n  # Only keep the respondent-level columns\n  select(resp.id, carpool)\nZ\n## # A tibble: 200 × 2\n##    resp.id carpool\n##      <dbl> <fct>  \n##  1       1 yes    \n##  2       2 no     \n##  3       3 no     \n##  4       4 no     \n##  5       5 yes    \n##  6       6 no     \n##  7       7 no     \n##  8       8 yes    \n##  9       9 no     \n## 10      10 no     \n## # ℹ 190 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n`X` and `Z` are then passed to Stan as separate matrices and used at different places in the model fitting process. Here's what that looks like in pseudo-Stan code. The matrix of individual characteristics `Z` is matrix-multiplied with a bunch of estimated $\\gamma$ coefficients (`Gamma` here) to generate individual-specific $\\beta$ coefficients (`Beta` here). The matrix of choices `X` is then matrix-multiplied with the individual-specific $\\beta$ coefficients to generate predicted outcomes (`Y` here). \n\n``` stan\nfor (r in 1:n_respondents) {\n  // All the individual-specific slopes and intercepts\n  Beta[,r] ~ multi_normal(Gamma * Z[,r], ...);\n\n  // All the question-level outcomes, using individual-specific slopes and intercepts\n  for (s in 1:n_questions) {\n     Y[r,s] ~ categorical_logit( X [r,s] * Beta[,r]);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's a neat way of working with multilevel models, but it's different from how I've always worked with them (and it requires working with raw Stan). As seen throughout this post, I'm a fan of {brms}'s formula-style syntax for specifying multilevel models, but {brms} can only work with one dataset at a time—you can't pass it both `X` and `Z` like you'd do with raw Stan. So I (naively) figured that this went beyond {brms}'s abilities and was only possible with raw Stan.\n\nHowever, if we use {brms}'s [special formula syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf), we can actually specify an identical model with only one dataset (again, [see this for a fantastic overview of the syntax](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#model-specification)).\n\nFirst, let's look at the marketing-style syntax again:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Choice} &\\sim \\operatorname{Multinomial\\ logit}(\\beta X) & \\text{where } X = \\text{feature levels} \\\\\n\\beta &\\sim \\operatorname{Multivariate} \\mathcal{N}(\\gamma Z, \\Sigma) & \\text{where } Z = \\text{individual characteristics}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is actually just a kind of *really* compact notation. That second line with the $\\beta \\sim \\operatorname{Multivariate}\\, \\mathcal{N}(\\cdot)$ distribution is a shorthand version of the full-β syntax from earlier. To illustrate this, let's expand this out to a more complete formal definition of the model. Instead of using $X$ to stand in for all the feature levels and $Z$ for all the individual characteristics, we'll expand those to include all the covariates we're using. And instead of calling the distribution \"Multinomial logit\" we'll call it \"Categorical\" so it aligns with Stan. It'll make for a *really massive formula*, but it shows what's really going on.\n\n::: {.column-page-inset}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\ \\textbf{Multinomial probability of selection of choice}_i \\textbf{ in respondent}_j \\\\\n\\text{Choice}_{i_j} \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\{\\mu_{1,i_j}, \\mu_{2,i_j}, \\mu_{3,i_j}\\}) \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Model for probability of each option} \\\\\n\\{\\mu_{1,i_j}, \\mu_{2,i_j}, \\mu_{3,i_j}\\} =&\\ \\beta_{0_j} + \\beta_{1_j} \\text{Seat[7]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{2_j} \\text{Seat[8]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{3_j} \\text{Cargo[3ft]}_{i_j} + \\\\\n&\\ \\beta_{4_j} \\text{Engine[hyb]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{5_j} \\text{Engine[elec]}_{i_j} + \\\\\n&\\ \\beta_{6_j} \\text{Price[35k]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{7_j} \\text{Price[40k]}_{i_j} \\\\[20pt]  \n&\\ \\textbf{Respondent-specific slopes} \\\\\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{c} \n    \\begin{aligned}\n      &\\beta_{0_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{1_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{2_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{3_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{4_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{5_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{6_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{7_j}\n    \\end{aligned}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right) \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Multivariate}\\ \\mathcal{N} \\left[\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{c} \n    \\begin{aligned}\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{0}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{0}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{1}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{1}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{2}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{2}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{3}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{3}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{4}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{4}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{5}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{5}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{6}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{6}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{7}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{7}}_{1}\\text{Carpool}\n    \\end{aligned}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n, \n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n     \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{0j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{1j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{2j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{1j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{2j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{2j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{4j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{4j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{4j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{5j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{5j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{6j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{7j}}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n:::\n\n\\ \n\nImportantly, pay attention to where the choice-level and respondent-level variables show up in this expanded version. All the choice-level variables have respondent-specific $\\beta$ coefficients, while the respondent-level variable (`carpool`) is down in that massive multivariate normal matrix with its own $\\gamma$ coefficients, helping determine the respondent-specific $\\beta$ coefficients. That's great and exactly what we want, and we can do that with raw Stan, but raw Stan is no fun.\n\nWe can create this exact same model structure with {brms} like this:\n\n``` r\nbf(choice_alt ~\n  # Choice-level predictors that are nested within respondents...\n  (seat + cargo + eng + price) *\n  # ...interacted with all respondent-level predictors...\n  (carpool) +\n  # ... with random

package](https://datalorax.github.io/equatiomatic/), which automatically converts model objects into LaTeX code. {equatiomatic} doesn't work with {brms} models, but it does work with frequentist {lme4} models, so we can fit a throwaway frequentist model with this syntax (it won't actually converge and it'll give a warning, but that's fine—we don't actually care about this model) and then feed it to `equatiomatic::extract_eq()` to see what it looks like in formal notation. \n\n(This is actually how I figured out the correct combination of interactions and random slopes—I kept trying different combinations that I thought were right until the math matched the huge full model above, with the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ terms in the right places.)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page

It lets us account for individual-specific differences across each of the minivan features. For instance, whether an individual carpools probably influences their preferences for the number of seats, and maybe cargo space, but probably doesn't influence their preferences for engine type. If we had other individual-level characteristics, we could also let those influence feature preferences. Like, the number of kids an individual has probably influences seat count preferences; the individual's income probably influences their price preferences; and so on.\n\nLet's define the model more formally again, this time with priors for the parameters we'll be estimating:\n\n::: {.column-page-inset}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\ \\textbf{Multinomial probability of selection of choice}_i \\textbf{ in respondent}_j \\\\\n\\text{Choice}_{i_j} \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Categorical}(\\{\\mu_{1,i_j}, \\mu_{2,i_j}, \\mu_{3,i_j}\\}) \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Model for probability of each option} \\\\\n\\{\\mu_{1,i_j}, \\mu_{2,i_j}, \\mu_{3,i_j}\\} =&\\ \\beta_{0_j} + \\beta_{1_j} \\text{Seat[7]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{2_j} \\text{Seat[8]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{3_j} \\text{Cargo[3ft]}_{i_j} + \\\\\n&\\ \\beta_{4_j} \\text{Engine[hyb]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{5_j} \\text{Engine[elec]}_{i_j} + \\\\\n&\\ \\beta_{6_j} \\text{Price[35k]}_{i_j} + \\beta_{7_j} \\text{Price[40k]}_{i_j} \\\\[20pt]  \n&\\ \\textbf{Respondent-specific slopes} \\\\\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{c} \n    \\begin{aligned}\n      &\\beta_{0_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{1_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{2_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{3_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{4_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{5_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{6_j} \\\\\n      &\\beta_{7_j}\n    \\end{aligned}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right) \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Multivariate}\\ \\mathcal{N} \\left[\n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{c} \n    \\begin{aligned}\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{0}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{0}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{1}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{1}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{2}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{2}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{3}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{3}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{4}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{4}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{5}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{5}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{6}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{6}}_{1}\\text{Carpool} \\\\\n      &\\gamma^{\\beta_{7}}_{0} + \\gamma^{\\beta_{7}}_{1}\\text{Carpool}\n    \\end{aligned}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n, \n\\left(\n  \\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n     \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{0j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{1j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{2j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{0j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{1j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{2j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{1j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{2j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{2j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{3j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{3j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{4j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{4j}\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{4j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{4j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{5j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{5j}\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{5j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{6j}} & \\rho_{\\beta_{6j}\\beta_{7j}} \\\\ \n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & \\sigma^2_{\\beta_{7j}}\n  \\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\right] \\\\[10pt]\n&\\ \\textbf{Priors} \\\\\n\\beta_{0 \\dots 7} \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N} (0, 3) \\qquad\\qquad\\ [\\text{Prior for choice-level coefficients}] \\\\\n\\gamma^{\\beta_{0 \\dots 7}}_0 \\sim&\\ \\mathcal{N} (0, 3) \\qquad\\qquad\\ [\\text{Prior for individual-level coefficients}] \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\beta_{0 \\dots 7}} \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{Exponential}(1) \\qquad [\\text{Prior for between-respondent intercept and slope variability}] \\\\\n\\rho \\sim&\\ \\operatorname{LKJ}(1) \\qquad\\qquad [\\text{Prior for correlation between random slopes and intercepts}]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n:::\n\n\\ \n\nHere it is in code form. There are a couple new things here in the Stan settings. First, we're going to create 4 MCMC chains with 4,000 draws rather than 2,000—there are so many parameters to be estimated that we need to let the simulation run longer. Second, we've modified the `adapt_delta` setting to 0.99. Conceptually, this adjusts the size of the steps the MCMC algorithm takes as it traverses the posterior space for each parameter—higher numbers make the steps smaller and more granular. This slows down the MCMC simulation, but it also helps avoid divergent transitions (or failed out-of-bounds draws).\n\nOn my 2021 M1 MacBook Pro, running through cmdstanr with 2 CPU cores per chain, it took about 30 minutes to fit.

In general, the market share for these six hypothetical products is roughly the same across carpoolers and non-carpoolers, with one obvious exception—among non-carpoolers, the \\$30,000 8-passenger gas minivan with 2 feet of space has 26% of the market, while among carpoolers it has 42%. Individuals who carpool apparently *really* care about the number of passengers their vehicle can carry.\n\n\n## AMCEs\n\nTo find the average marginal component effects (AMCEs), or the causal effect of moving one of these features to another value, holding all other variables constant, we can go through [the same process as before](#bayesian-comparisonscontrasts-1). We'll calculate the predicted probabilities of choosing option 0, 1, 2, and 3 across a full grid of all the combinations of feature levels *and* carpool status. We'll then filter those predictions to only look at option 0 and reverse the predicted probabilities. Again, that feels weird, but it's a neat little trick—if there's a 33% chance that someone will select a specific combination of features, that would imply a 66% chance of not selecting it and an 11% chance of selecting it when it appears in option 1, option 2, and option 3. Rather than adding the probabilities within those three options together, we can do 100% − 66% to get the same 33% value, only it's automatically combined.\n\nEarlier we had 54 combinations—now we have 108 (54 × 2). We'll set `resp.id` to one that's not in the dataset (201) so that these effects all deal with a generic hypothetical respondent (we could also do some fancy \"integrating out\" work and find population-level averages; [see here for more about that](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/11/29/conditional-marginal-marginaleffects/)).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnewdata_all_combos_carpool <- minivans %>% \n  tidyr::expand(seat, cargo, eng, price, carpool) %>% \n  mutate(resp.id = 201)\nnewdata_all_combos_carpool\n## # A tibble: 108 × 6\n##    seat  cargo eng   price carpool resp.id\n##    <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct> <fct>     <dbl>\n##  1 6     2ft   gas   30    no          201\n##  2 6     2ft   gas   30    yes         201\n##  3 6     2ft   gas   35    no          201\n##  4 6     2ft   gas   35    yes         201\n##  5 6     2ft   gas   40    no          201\n##  6 6     2ft   gas   40    yes         201\n##  7 6     2ft   hyb   30    no          201\n##  8 6     2ft   hyb   30    yes         201\n##  9 6     2ft   hyb   35    no          201\n## 10 6     2ft   hyb   35    yes         201\n## # ℹ 98 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext we can plug this grid into the model, filter to only keep option 0, and reverse the predictions:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall_preds_brms_carpool <- model_minivans_mega_mlm_brms %>% \n  epred_draws(\n    newdata = newdata_all_combos_carpool,\n    re_formula = NULL, allow_new_levels = TRUE\n  ) %>% \n  filter(.category == 0) %>% \n  mutate(.epred = 1 - .epred)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis thing has 1.7 million rows in it, so we need to group and summarize to do anything useful with it.

An individual's carpooling behavior interacts with seat count (increasing the seat count causes carpoolers to select the minivan more often), and it also interacts a bit with cargo space (increasing the cargo space makes both types of individuals more likely to select the minivan, but moreso for carpoolers) and also with price (increasing the price makes both types of individuals less likely to select the minivan, but moreso for carpoolers). Switching from gas → hybrid and gas → electric has a negative effect on both types of consumers, and there's no carpooling-based difference.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Extract variable labels\"}\nminivan_var_levels <- tibble(\n  variable = c(\"seat\", \"cargo\", \"eng\", \"price\")\n) %>% \n  mutate(levels = map(variable, ~{\n    x <- minivans[[.x]]\n    if (is.numeric(x)) {\n      \"\"\n    } else if (is.factor(x)) {\n      levels(x)\n    } else {\n      sort(unique(x))\n    }\n  })) %>% \n  unnest(levels) %>% \n  mutate(term = paste0(variable, levels))\n\n# Make a little lookup table for nicer feature labels\nminivan_var_lookup <- tribble(\n  ~variable, ~variable_nice,\n  \"seat\",    \"Passengers\",\n  \"cargo\",   \"Cargo space\",\n  \"eng\",     \"Engine type\",\n  \"price\",   \"Price (thousands of $)\"\n) %>% \n  mutate(variable_nice = fct_inorder(variable_nice))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Combine full dataset of factor levels with marginalized posterior draws and make plot\"}\nposterior_amces_minivan_carpool_nested <- amces_minivan_carpool %>% \n  separate_wider_delim(\n    contrast,\n    delim = \" - \", \n    names = c(\"variable_level\", \"reference_level\")\n  ) %>% \n  group_by(term, variable_level) %>% \n  nest()\n\nplot_data_minivan_carpool <- minivan_var_levels %>%\n  left_join(\n    posterior_amces_minivan_carpool_nested,\n    by = join_by(variable == term, levels == variable_level)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(data = map_if(data, is.null, ~ tibble(avg = 0))) %>% \n  unnest(data) %>% \n  left_join(minivan_var_lookup, by = join_by(variable)) %>% \n  mutate(across(c(levels, variable_nice), ~fct_inorder(.))) %>% \n  # Make the missing carpool values be \"yes\" for the reference category\n  mutate(carpool = replace_na(carpool, \"yes\"))\n\nplot_data_minivan_carpool %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = avg, y = levels, fill = variable_nice)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +\n  stat_halfeye(aes(slab_alpha = carpool), normalize = \"groups\") + \n  facet_col(facets = \"variable_nice\", scales = \"free_y\", space = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_pp) +\n  scale_slab_alpha_discrete(\n    range = c(0.4, 1),\n    labels = c(\"Non-carpoolers\", \"Carpoolers\"),\n    guide = guide_legend(\n      reverse = TRUE, override.aes = list(fill = \"grey10\"), \n      keywidth = 0.8, keyheight = 0.8\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = clrs[c(3, 7, 8, 9)], guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Percentage point change in probability of minivan selection\",\n    y = NULL,\n    title = \"AMCEs across respondent carpool status\",\n    slab_alpha = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.justification = \"left\",\n    legend.margin = margin(l = -7, t = 0)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot-amces-minivans-carpool-1.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\n# tl;dr: Moral of the story\n\nholy crap this might be the longest guide I've ever posted here.

Use multilevel multinomial models to account for all the heterogeneity in choices and individuals.\n\n- {brms} provides a powerful, easy-to-use frontend for running complex multilevel models in Stan.
